  abstract =    {The nerve fiber layer of the human retina is made up of the retinal segments of ganglion cell axons. Its geometry can be described mathematically as a fibration of a 2D domain: a partition of a certain region into smooth curves. Here, we present a simple family of curves that closely models the observed geometry of the nerve fiber layer. For each retina, the pattern depends on 2 parameters, A and B: A computer program determines A and B for a given retina and the theory matches the retina with a standard deviation of approximate to 6-8 degrees. These particular curves turn out to be the curves that would be generated if the growing ganglion cell axon tip moved down a gradient toward a source of diffusible neuroattractant at the disk and away from a weaker macular diffusible repellant. Thus, this model provides morphological evidence that diffusible substances provide positional information to the embryonic ganglion cell axons in finding their way to the optic nerve head.},

To investigate the distributions of threshold estimates with the Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithms (SITA) Standard, SITA Fast, and the Full Threshold algorithm (Humphrey Field Analyzer; Zeiss-Humphrey Instruments, Dublin, CA) and to compare the pointwise test-retest variability of these strategies. METHODS. One eye of 49 patients (mean age, 61.6 years; range. 22-81) with glaucoma (Mean Deviation mean, -7.13 dB; range, +1.8 to -23.9 dB) was examined four times with each of the three strategies. The mean and median SITA Standard and SITA Fast threshold estimates were compared with a "best available" estimate of sensitivity (mean results of three Full Threshold tests). Pointwise 90% retest limits (5th and 95th percentiles of retest thresholds) were derived to assess the reproducibility of individual threshold estimates. RESULTS. The differences between the threshold estimates of the SITA and Full Threshold strategies were largest (approximate to3 dB) for midrange sensitivities (approximate to15 dB). The threshold distributions of SITA were considerably different from those of the Full Threshold strategy. The differences remained of similar magnitude when the analysis was repeated on a subset of 20 locations that are examined early during the course of a Full Threshold examination. With sensitivities above 25 dB, both SITA strategies exhibited lower test-retest variability than the Full Threshold strategy. Below 25 dB, the retest intervals of SITA Standard were slightly smaller than those of the Full Threshold strategy, whereas those of SITA Fast were larger. CONCLUSIONS. SITA Standard may be superior to the Full Threshold strategy for monitoring patients with visual field loss. The greater test-retest variability of SITA Fast in areas of low sensitivity is Likely to offset the benefit of even shorter test durations with this strategy. The sensitivity differences between the SITA and Full Threshold strategies may relate to factors other than reduced fatigue. They are, however, small in comparison to the test-retest variability.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To describe a methodology for establishing signal-tonoise ratios (SNRs) for different perimetric techniques, and to compare SNRs of frequency-doubling technology (FDT2) perimetry and standard automated perimetry (SAP). METHODS. Fifteen patients with open-angle glaucoma (median MD, -2.6 dB, range +0.2 to -16.1 dB) were tested six times with FDT2 and SAP (SITA Standard program 24-2) within a 4-week period. Signals were estimated from the average superior-inferior difference between the mean deviation (MD) values in five mirror-pair sectors of the Glaucoma Hemifield Test, and noise from the dispersion of these differences over the six repeated tests. SNRs of FDT2 and SAP were compared by mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS. There was moderate correlation between the signals of FDT2 and SAP (r(2) = 0.68, P < 0.001), but no correlation of noise (r(2) = 0.01, P = 0.16). Although both signal as well as noise estimates were higher with FDT2 compared with SAP, 60% to 70% of sector pairs showed higher SNRs with FDT2. The SNRs of FDT2 were between 20% and 40% higher than those of SAP (P = 0.01). There were no meaningful differences between parametric and nonparametric estimates of signal, noise, or SNR. CONCLUSION. The higher SNRs of FDT2 suggest that this technique is at least as efficient as SAP at detecting localized visual field losses. Signal/noise analyses may provide a useful approach for comparing visual field tests independent of their decibel scales and may provide an initial indication of sensitivity to visual field change over time.

The GHT uses empirically determined limits of normality for up-down differences in the Statpac probability maps of the Humphrey Field Analyzer to detect localized visual field loss. It is also constructed to detect field loss that is symmetric around the horizontal meridian. Analysis is done in five corresponding pairs of sectors that are based on the normal anatomy of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Deviations from the age-corrected normal threshold in the most sensitive portions of the visual field are used to detect general reductions of sensitivity or abnormally high sensitivities. The GHT provides brief visual field evaluations printed on the field chart as plain text. The aim of this article is to describe the fundamentals of the analysis program and to provide clinical examples.},

Dependency coding and information maximization appear to be central principles in neural coding early in the visual system. These principles may be relevant to how we think about higher visual processes such as face recognition as well. The paper first reviews examples of dependency learning in biological vision, along with principles of optimal information transfer and information maximization. Next, we examine algorithms for face recognition by computer from a perspective of information maximization. The eigenface approach can be considered as an unsupervised system that learns the first- and second-order dependencies among face image pixels. Eigenfaces maximize information transfer only in the case where the input distributions are Gaussian. Independent component analysis (ICA) learns high-order dependencies in addition to first- and second-order relations, and maximizes information transfer for a more general set of input distributions. Face representations based on ICA gave better recognition performance than eigenfaces, supporting the theory that information maximization is a good strategy for high level visual functions such as face recognition. Finally, we review perceptual studies suggesting that dependency learning is relevant to human face perception as well, and present an information maximization account of perceptual effects such as the atypicality bias, and face adaptation aftereffects.

To compare the performance of neural networks for perimetric glaucoma diagnosis when using different types of data inputs: numerical threshold sensitivities, Statpac Total Deviation and Pattern Deviation, and probability scores based on Total and Pattern Deviation probability maps (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). METHODS. The results of SITA Standard visual field tests in 213 healthy subjects, 127 patients with glaucoma, 68 patients with concomitant glaucoma and cataract, and 41 patients with cataract only were included. The five different types of input data were entered into five identically designed artificial neural networks. Network thresholds were adjusted for each network. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to display the combinations of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS. Input data in the form of Pattern Deviation probability scores gave the best results, with an area of 0.988 under the ROC curve, and were significantly better (P < 0.001) than threshold sensitivities and numerical Total Deviations and Total Deviation probability scores. The second best result was obtained with numerical Pattern Deviations with an area of 0.980. CONCLUSIONS. The choice of type of data input had important effects on the performance of the neural networks in glaucoma diagnosis. Refined input data, based on Pattern Deviations, resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity than did raw threshold values. Neural networks may have high potential in the production of useful clinical tools for the classification of visual field tests.},

  abstract =    {Purpose: Visual field assessment is extremely important in glaucoma management, but interpretation is affected by the quality of the patient's performance, The authors have investigated the reliability of visual field performance by a randomly selected sample of the chronic glaucoma population at an urban tertiary care practice. Methods: Patient reliability in Humphrey automated visual field testing was studied in 106 randomly selected chronic open-angle glaucoma patient charts, which provided 768 tests (mean, 7.2 +/- 4.8 fields; range, 2-18 fields). Reliability criteria were established as less than 20% fixation losses, less than 33% false-negative error, and less than 33% false-positive error, as recommended by Humphrey Instruments, Inc (San Leandro, CA). Results: Patients performed reliably in 61% of right eye fields, 58% of left eye fields, and 59.5% overall. Of the 106 patients, only 35 (33%) were always reliable in both eyes, whereas 8 (7.5%) were always unreliable in both eyes, The most common cause of unreliability was fixation loss (39%), whereas false-positive error (5%) and false-negative error (9%) were less frequent. A more severely depressed mean deviation correlated significantly with poorer performance on the three reliability indices, with false-negative error having the greatest correlation, followed by fixation loss and false-positive error. Corrected pattern standard deviation correlated closely only with false-negative error. Prolonged test time also correlated with all three reliability indices. Age was a significant factor for fixation loss but not for false-negative or false-positive error. Conclusions: The authors conclude that fewer than two thirds of the Humphrey visual fields were reliable with the authors' urban tertiary care population of patients with glaucoma. Relaxing the fixation loss criterion to less than 33% improved the rate of reliability to approximately 75%. The severity of glaucomatous visual field defects, test time, and age were identified as factors influencing the reliability of the Humphrey visual fields.},

Methods: SITA Standard 30-2 visual fields, from 100 glaucoma patients and 116 healthy participants, formed the data set. Our ANN was a previously described fully trained network using scored pattern deviation probability maps as input data. Its diagnostic accuracy was compared to that of the Glaucoma Hemifield Test, the Pattern Standard Deviation index at the P < 5% and < 1%, and also to a technique based on the recognizing clusters of significantly depressed test points. Results: The included tests had early to moderate visual field loss (median MD = -6.16 dB). ANN achieved a sensitivity of 93% at a specificity level of 94% with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.984. Glaucoma Hemifield Test attained a sensitivity of 92% at 91% specificity. Pattern Standard Deviation, with a cut off level at P < 5% had a sensitivity of 89% with a specificity of 93 %, whereas at P < 1% the sensitivity and specificity was 72% and 97%, respectively. The cluster algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 82%. Conclusions: The high diagnostic performance of our ANN based on refined input visual field data was confirmed in this independent sample. Its diagnostic accuracy was slightly to considerably better than that of the compared algorithms. The results indicate the large potential for ANN as an important clinical glaucoma diagnostic tool.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE: To determine typical patterns of repeatable glaucomatous visual field progression. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data obtained from two prospective studies. METHODS: Included were 72 eyes of 72 patients tested up to six times over 2 years, and 40 eyes of 40 patients followed annually for up to 12 years. Each patient had two abnormal baseline visual fields, abnormal optic nerves, and serial fields. Progression was identified using three methods: by glaucoma change probability using total deviation (GCP-TD) and pattern deviation (GCP-PD) plots and by a clinical criteria. Progression was categorized as deepening or expansion of an existing scotoma, or a new scotoma. RESULTS: The percentage of eyes repeatably progressed ranged from 17% to 27%. The most common pattern of progression was a deepening of an existing scotoma in the annual group, followed by expansion. With two follow, ups required, percentages for deepening only were 20% (clinical classifier). A combination of expansion and deepening was most common for the GCP criteria: 15% (GCP-TD classifier), and 10% (GCP-PD classifier) for the annual group. For the semiannual group, deepening was most common with the clinical criteria (11% of eyes), and deepening with expansion was most common by GCP criteria (14%, GCP-TD and GCP-PD). No eyes showed repeatable new scotomas. CONCLUSIONS: Glaucomatous visual fields progress in the area of the visual field where baseline testing showed an existing scotoma. Follow-up testing might be improved by concentrating on already defective locations and using sparser test patterns or screening algorithms in normal areas of the visual field.

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To compare machine learning classifiers trained on three clustering schemes to determine whether distinguishing healthy eyes from those with glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) can be optimized by training with clustered data. METHODS. Two machine learning classifiers-quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and support vector machines with Gaussian kernel (SVMg)-were trained separately using standard perimetry data from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS), clustered using three clustering schemes on a training data set (123 eyes/123 glaucoma patients with GON; 135 eyes/135 normal control subjects). Trained classifiers were then applied to an independent data set containing 69 eyes of 69 glaucoma patients with early visual field loss and 83 eyes of 83 normal control subjects. Two control conditions were included: unclustered data and a random assignment of locations to clusters. RESULTS. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve ranged from 0.85 (SVMg, thresholds clustered by Glaucoma Hemifield Test sectors) to 0.92 (QDA, thresholds clustered by Garway-Heath mapping) for the training data set. Use of clustered data showed no significant optimization of sensitivity over use of unclustered data, and no single clustering method resulted in significantly higher performance in the independent data set. Sensitivities tended to be higher with QDA than with SVMg, regardless of specificity cutoff and clustering method. CONCLUSIONS. QDA performed better with the early glaucoma data set than did the SVMg. Clustering may be advantageous when data-dimension reduction is needed-for example, when combining field results with other high-dimensional data (e. g., structural imaging data)-but it is not necessary for visual field data alone.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To determine whether neural network techniques can improve differentiation between glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes, using the optic disc topography parameters of the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). METHODS. With the HRT, one eye was imaged from each of 108 patients with glaucoma (defined as having repeatable visual field defects with standard automated perimetry) and 189 subjects without glaucoma (no visual field defects with healthy-appearing optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer on clinical examination) and the optic nerve topography was defined by 17 global and 66 regional HRT parameters. With all the HRT parameters used as input, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for the classification of eyes, by three neural network techniques: linear and Gaussian support vector machines (SVM linear and SVM Gaussian, respectively) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP), as well as four previously proposed linear discriminant functions (LDFs) and one LDF developed on the current data with all HRT parameters used as input. RESULTS. The areas under the ROC curves for SVM linear and SVM Gaussian were 0.938 and 0.945, respectively; for MLP, 0.941; for the current LDF, 0.906; and for the best previously proposed LDF, 0.890. With the use of forward selection and backward elimination optimization techniques, the areas under the ROC curves for SVM Gaussian and the current LDF were increased to approximately 0.96. CONCLUSIONS. Trained neural networks, with global and regional HRT parameters used as input, improve on previously proposed HRT parameter-based LDFs for discriminating between glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes. The performance of both neural networks and LDFs can be improved with optimization of the features in the input.

Univariate analyses indicated that all classification techniques were predictors of the development of two repeatable abnormal SAP results, with hazards ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) ranging from 1.32 (1.00-1.75) for HRTC to 2.0 (1.48-2.76) for stereophotograph assessment (all P less than or equal to 0.05). Only SVM ( SVM fwd and SVM back) analysis of HRT data and stereophotograph assessment were univariate predictors of the development of three repeatable abnormal SAP results, with hazard ratios (95% CI) ranging from 1.73 (1.16-2.82) for SVM fwd to 1.82 (1.19-3.12) for SVM back (both P < 0.007). Multivariate analyses including each classification technique individually in a model with age, baseline SAP pattern standard deviation [PSD], and baseline IOP indicated that all classification techniques except HRTC (P = 0.06) were predictors of the development of two repeatable abnormal SAP results with hazards ratios ranging from 1.30 (0.99, 1.73) for HRTC to 1.90 (1.37, 2.69) for stereophotograph assessment. Only SVM ( SVM fwd and SVM back) analysis of HRT data and stereophotograph assessment were significant predictors of the development of three repeatable abnormal SAP results in multivariate analyses; hazard ratios of 1.57 (1.03, 2.59) and 1.70 (1.18, 2.51), respectively. SAP PSD was a significant predictor of two repeatable abnormal SAP results in multivariate models with all classification techniques, with hazard ratios ranging from 3.31 (1.39, 7.89) to 4.70 (2.02, 10.93) per 1-dB increase. CONCLUSIONS. HRT classifications techniques and stereophotograph assessment can detect optic disc topography abnormalities in glaucoma-suspect eyes before the development of SAP abnormalities. These data support strongly the importance of optic disc examination for early glaucoma diagnosis.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To classify healthy and glaucomatous eyes using relevance vector machine (RVM) and support vector machine (SVM) learning classifiers trained on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements obtained by scanning laser polarimetry (SLP). METHODS. Seventy-two eyes of 72 healthy control subjects ( average age = 64.3 +/- 8.8 years, visual field mean deviation = - 0.71 +/- 1.2 dB) and 92 eyes of 92 patients with glaucoma ( average age = 66.9 +/- 8.9 years, visual field mean deviation = - 5.32 +/- 4.0 dB) were imaged with SLP with variable corneal compensation (GDx VCC; Laser Diagnostic Technologies, San Diego, CA). RVM and SVM learning classifiers were trained and tested on SLP-determined RNFL thickness measurements from 14 standard parameters and 64 sectors ( approximately 5.6 degrees each) obtained in the circumpapillary area under the instrument-defined measurement ellipse ( total 78 parameters). Tenfold cross-validation was used to train and test RVM and SVM classifiers on unique subsets of the full 164-eye data set and areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for the classification of eyes in the test set were generated. AUROC curve results from RVM and SVM were compared to those for 14 SLP software-generated global and regional RNFL thickness parameters. Also reported was the AUROC curve for the GDx VCC software-generated nerve fiber indicator (NFI). RESULTS. The AUROC curves for RVM and SVM were 0.90 and 0.91, respectively, and increased to 0.93 and 0.94 when the training sets were optimized with sequential forward and backward selection ( resulting in reduced dimensional data sets). AUROC curves for optimized RVM and SVM were significantly larger than those for all individual SLP parameters. The AUROC curve for the NFI was 0.87. CONCLUSIONS. Results from RVM and SVM trained on SLP RNFL thickness measurements are similar and provide accurate classification of glaucomatous and healthy eyes. RVM may be preferable to SVM, because it provides a Bayesian-derived probability of glaucoma as an output. These results suggest that these machine learning classifiers show good potential for glaucoma diagnosis.},

Interventions: Automated static threshold perimetry (performed with either the Octopus G1 program, Interzeag, Schlieren, Switzerland, or the Humphrey 24-2 program, Allergan Humphrey, San Leandro, Calif) and confocal optic disc tomography (performed with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph, Heidelberg [Germany] Engineering GmbH) were performed on one randomly selected eye per patient. Main Outcome Measure: The correlation between the visual field indexes, namely, the mean deviation and corrected pattern SD, and the topographic measurements for the optic disc and nerve fiber layer. Results: A statistically significant correlation was found between the third central moment of the frequency distribution of the depth values for the optic disc structures and the visual field indexes. Pearson correlation coefficients were r = -.65 (P < .0001) and r = .55 (P < .0001) for the mean deviation and corrected pattern SD, respectively. Conclusion: The third central moment of the depth distribution for the optic disc measurements is strongly related to the overall shape of the optic disc cup and is a robust indicator of the degree of glaucomatous optic nerve damage.},

METHODS: Several neural network algorithms were tested with a database of 185 eyes of patients with early glaucomatous visual field loss (average mean defect, 4.5 dB) and 54 eyes of age-matched normal control subjects. The information used included automated visual field indices (mean defect, corrected loss variance, and short-term fluctuation) and structural data (cup/disk ratio, rim area, cup volume, and nerve fiber layer height) from computerized image analysis. RESULTS: A back propagation network with two intermediate layers assigned an estimated probability of being glaucomatous to each eye and correctly identified 88% of all eyes with 90% sensitivity and 84% specificity. The same neural network trained with only structural data correctly identified 80% of the eyes with 87% sensitivity and 56% specificity, and when trained with functional data only, if correctly identified 84% of the eyes with 84% sensitivity and 86% specificity. CONCLUSION: Analysis of several optic nerve and visual field variables by neural networks can help identify early glaucomatous damage and assign an estimated probability that early damage is present in individual patients.},

Methods: Two hundred thirty-three series of Octopus G1 visual fields of 181 patients with glaucoma were collected. Each series was composed of 4 or more reliable visual fields from patients who had previously undergone automated perimetry. The visual fields were independently evaluated in a masked fashion by 3 experienced observers (K.N.-M, M.W., and J.C.) and were judged to show progression based on the agreement of 2 observers. The stable and progressed series were matched for mean defect at baseline. The threshold data were submitted to a back propagation neural network that was trained to classify each series as stable or progressed. Two thirds of the data were used for the training and the remaining one third to test the performance of the network. This was repeated 3 times to classify all of the series (changing the training and test series). Results: Fifty-nine series of visual fields showed progression and 151 were judged stable. Neural network sensitivity was 73% and specificity was 88% (threshold for progression = 0.5). The concordance of the neural network with the observers was good (0.50 less than or equal to kappa greater than or equal to 0.64). Conclusions: A neural network can be trained to recognize visual field progression in good concordance with experienced observers.

Many severity classification methods have been proposed, although none have had widespread use in clinical practice.

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. Machine-learning classifiers are trained computerized systems with the ability to detect the relationship between multiple input parameters and a diagnosis. The present study investigated whether the use of machine-learning classifiers improves optical coherence tomography (OCT) glaucoma detection. METHODS. Forty-seven patients with glaucoma ( 47 eyes) and 42 healthy subjects ( 42 eyes) were included in this cross-sectional study. Of the glaucoma patients, 27 had early disease ( visual field mean deviation [MD] >= - 6 dB) and 20 had advanced glaucoma (MD < - 6 dB). Machine-learning classifiers were trained to discriminate between glaucomatous and healthy eyes using parameters derived from OCT output. The classifiers were trained with all 38 parameters as well as with only 8 parameters that correlated best with the visual field MD. Five classifiers were tested: linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, recursive partitioning and regression tree, generalized linear model, and generalized additive model. For the last two classifiers, a backward feature selection was used to find the minimal number of parameters that resulted in the best and most simple prediction. The cross-validated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and accuracies were calculated. RESULTS. The largest area under the ROC curve (AROC) for glaucoma detection was achieved with the support vector machine using eight parameters (0.981). The sensitivity at 80% and 95% specificity was 97.9% and 92.5%, respectively. This classifier also performed best when judged by cross-validated accuracy (0.966). The best classification between early glaucoma and advanced glaucoma was obtained with the generalized additive model using only three parameters ( AROC = 0.854). CONCLUSIONS. Automated machine classifiers of OCT data might be useful for enhancing the utility of this technology for detecting glaucomatous abnormality.},

Here we propose these models to improve the classification of glaucoma, a major cause of blindness worldwide. We use visual field and retinal data to predict the early onset of glaucoma. In particular, the ability of BNs to deal with missing data allows us to select an optimal data-driven network by comparing supervised and semi-supervised models. An expertise-driven BN is also built by encoding expert knowledge in terms of relations between variables. In order to improve the overall performances for classification and to explore the relations between glaucomatous data and expert knowledge, the expertise-driven network is combined with the selected data-driven network using a BN-based approach. An accuracy-weighted combination of these networks is also compared to the other models. The best performances are obtained with the semi-supervised data-driven network. However, combining it with the expertise-driven network improves performance in many cases and leads to interesting insights about the datasets, networks and metrics.},

  abstract =    {Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic structural changes in the optic nerve head reflected in the visual field. The visual-field sensitivity test is commonly used in a clinical setting to evaluate glaucoma. Standard automated perimetry (SAP) is a common computerized visual-field test whose output is amenable to machine learning. We compared the performance of a number of machine learning algorithms with STATPAC indexes mean deviation, pattern standard deviation, and corrected pattern standard deviation. The machine learning algorithms studied, included multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Parzen window, mixture of Gaussian (MOG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG). MLP and SVM are classifiers that work directly on the decision boundary and fall under the discriminative paradigm. Generative classifiers, which first model the data probability density and then perform classification via Bayes' rule, usually give deeper insight into the structure of the data space. We have applied MOG, MGG, LDA, QDA, and Parzen window to the classification of glaucoma from SAP. Performance of the various classifiers was compared by the areas under their receiver operating characteristic curves and by sensitivities (true-positive rates) at chosen specificities (true-negative rates). The machine-learning-type classifiers showed improved performance over the best indexes from STATPAC. Forward-selection and backward-elimination methodology further improved the classification rate and also has the potential to reduce testing time by diminishing the number of visual-field location measurements.},

  abstract =    {Objective: To determine whether glaucoma patients with progressive optic disc change have subsequent visual field progression earlier and at a faster rate compared with those without disc change. Design: Prospective, longitudinal, cohort study. Participants and Controls: Eighty-one patients with open-angle glaucoma. Methods: Patients underwent confocal scanning laser tomography and standard automated perimetry every 6 months. The complete follow-up was divided into initial and subsequent periods. Two initial periods-first 3 years (Protocol A) and first half of the total follow-up (Protocol B)-were used, with the respective remainder being the subsequent follow-up. Disc change during the initial follow-up was determined with liberal, moderate, or conservative criteria of the Topographic Change Analysis. Subsequent field progression was determined with significant pattern deviation change in >= 3 locations (criterion used in the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial). As a control analysis, field change during the initial follow-up was determined with significant pattern deviation change in >= 1, >= 2, or >= 3 locations. Main Outcome Measures: Survival time to subsequent field progression, rates of mean deviation (MD) change, and positive and negative likelihood ratios. Results: The median (interquartile range) total follow-up was 11.0 (8.0-12.0) years with 22 (18-24) examinations. More patients had disc changes during the initial follow-up compared with field changes. The mean time to field progression was consistently shorter (protocol A, 0.8-1.7 years; protocol B, 0.3-0.7 years) in patients with prior disc change. In the control analysis, patients with prior field change had statistically earlier subsequent field progression (protocol A, 2.9-3.0 years; protocol B, 0.7-0.9). Similarly, patients with either prior disc or field change always had worse mean rates of subsequent MD change, although the distributions overlapped widely. Patients with subsequent field progression were up to 3 times more likely to have prior disc change compared with those without, and up to 5 times more likely to have prior field change compared with those without. Conclusions: Longitudinally measured optic disc change is predictive of subsequent visual field progression and may be an efficacious end point for functional outcomes in clinical studies and trials in glaucoma.

We tested 25 workers (20 males) and 25 controls with no history of chronic exposure to solvents (10 males). All participants had normal ophthalmologic exams. Subjects had worked in gas stations on an average of 9.6 +/- 6.2 years. Color vision was evaluated with the Lanthony D15d and Cambridge Colour Test (CCT). Visual field assessment consisted of white-on-white 24-2 automatic perimetry (Humphrey II-750i). Contrast sensitivity was measured for sinusoidal gratings of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 cycles per degree (cpd). Results from both groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The number of errors in the D15d was higher for workers relative to controls (p<0.01). Their CCT color discrimination thresholds were elevated compared to the control group along the protan, deutan and tritan confusion axes (p<0.01), and their ellipse area and ellipticity were higher (p<0.01). Genetic analysis of subjects with very elevated color discrimination thresholds excluded congenital causes for the visual losses. Automated perimetry thresholds showed elevation in the 9 degrees, 15 degrees and 21 degrees of eccentricity (p<0.01) and in MD and PSD indexes (p<0.01). Contrast sensitivity losses were found for all spatial frequencies measured (p<0.01) except for 0.5 cpd. Significant correlation was found between previous working years and deutan axis thresholds (rho = 0.59; p<0.05), indexes of the Lanthony D15d (rho = 0.52; p<0.05), perimetry results in the fovea (rho = -0.51; p<0.05) and at 3, 9 and 15 degrees of eccentricity (rho = -0.46; p<0.05).

This paper shows how the relative performance of PCA and ICA depends on the task statement, the ICA architecture, the ICA algorithm, and (for PCA) the subspace distance metric. It then explores the space of PCA/ICA comparisons by systematically testing two ICA algorithms and two ICA architectures against PCA with four different distance measures on two tasks (facial identity and facial expression). In the process, this paper verifies the results of many of the previous comparisons in the literature, and relates them to each other and to this work. We are able to show that the FastICA algorithm configured according to ICA architecture II yields the highest performance for identifying faces, while the InfoMax algorithm configured according to ICA architecture II is better for recognizing facial actions. In both cases, PCA performs well but not as well as ICA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The direct costs associated with the disease often continue to increase as glaucoma progresses from the earliest to most advanced stages. Determinations of the costs associated with glaucoma progression and prevention should also incorporate the chance of patient non-compliance with treatment. Since glaucoma severity most often correlates with increased costs, minimizing or halting visual field loss and increasing patient treatment compliance may all contribute to a reduction in the overall economic burden of glaucoma.},

  abstract =    {Background: The Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed (1) to determine the better of two surgical management strategies for glaucoma when medical treatment alone no longer adequately controls the disease and (2) to clarify the clinical course and prognosis of open-angle glaucoma after surgical interventions have begun. The investigators of this study have developed quantitative methods to assess the test reliability and measure the severity of glaucomatous visual field defects with the 24-2 threshold program of the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. This report details these methods and presents information about long-term fluctuation during a time interval short enough to render change due to disease unlikely. Methods: In AGIS, reliability assessment of automated visual field tests is based on the number of questions asked; percent of fixation losses, false-positive responses, and false-negative responses; and amount of short-term fluctuation. The AGIS visual field defect score is based on the number and depth of clusters of adjacent depressed test sites in the upper and lower hemifields and in the nasal area of the total deviation printout of the threshold program single-field test STATPAC-2 analysis. The score ranges from 0 (no defect) to 20 (all test sites deeply depressed). The fluctuation in score between two tests obtained during an interval preceding AGIS surgical interventions, ranging from 1 day to 6 weeks on 756 eyes of 562 patients, is analyzed. Results: The scores of the first visual field tests, which determined eligibility for the study, range from 1 to 17. Large positive or negative intertest fluctuations (absolute changes of 4 or more) occurred in the second tests for 16% of eyes; more scores improved (11%) than worsened (5%). The frequency of large fluctuations tended to increase as the time interval between tests increased. Absolute intertest fluctuations were independent of age. Conclusion: For visual field tests obtained with the automated perimeter, AGIS investigators have developed objective, quantitative methods of scoring test reliability and severity of glaucomatous field toss. For 16% of eyes, long-term fluctuations were large enough (greater than or equal to 4 points) to suggest improvement or worsening of the glaucomatous defect even though the interval in which the fluctuations occurred was short enough (median time, approximately 1 week) to render changes in disease status unlikely.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To evaluate the relationship between electrophysiological, psychophysical, and structural measurements in normal and glaucomatous eyes and to test the hypothesis that there is a continuous structure-function relationship between ganglion cell numbers and visual field sensitivity. METHODs. Thirty-four normal subjects and 40 patients with glaucoma were examined with the pattern electroretinogram. (PERG), perimetry and retinal tomography. Transient and steady state (SS) PERGs were recorded, and peak (P)-to-trough (N) amplitude was measured. The unit of differential light sensitivity (DLS) in perimetry is the decibel. The decibel is 10 . log(1/Lambert), where the Lambert is the unit of test spot intensity. PERG amplitudes were correlated with decibel and 1/Lambert DLS for the central 18degrees of the visual field and with neuroretinal rim area in the temporal part of the optic disc. Age-related changes in the structural and functional measurements were sought. The correlation between variables was investigated by linear and quadratic regression analysis. A quadratic (y = ax + bx(2) + c) fit was taken to be significantly better than a Linear fit, if the coefficient (b) for the x(2) term was significant at P < 0.05. RESULTS. A quadratic fit between decibel DLS and PERG amplitude (transient PERG: R-2 = 0.40, P = 0.0000; SS PERG: R-2 = 0.32, P = 0.0000) was significantly better than a linear fit. There was a linear correlation between 1/Lambert DLS and PERG amplitude (transient PERG: R-2 = 0.44, P = 0.0000; SS PERG: R-2 = 0.35, P = 0.0000). There was a Linear correlation between temporal neuroretinal rim area and PERG amplitude (transient PERG: R-2 = 0.17, P = 0.0003; SS PERG: R-2 = 0.20, P = 0,0001). A quadratic fit between decibel DLS and temporal neuroretinal rim area (R-2 = 0.38, P = 0.0000) was significantly better than a linear fit. There was a Linear correlation between 1/Lambert DLS and temporal neuroretinal rim area (R-2 = 0.30, P = 0.0000). Both DLS and PERG amplitude declined with age in the normal subjects. The rate of decline was -0.17%, -0.74%, -0.75%, and -0.78% per year for decibel DLS, 1/Lambert DLS, transient PERG, and SS PERG, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. There is a curvilinear relationship between decibel DLS and both PERG amplitude and neuroretinal rim area, and a linear relationship between 1/Lambert DLS and PERG amplitude and neuroretinal rim area. These findings support the hypothesis that there is no ganglion cell functional reserve but a continuous structure-function relationship, and that the impression of a functional reserve results from the logarithmic (decibel) scaling of the Visual field.},

  abstract =    {Purpose: Glaucoma is a prevalent ophthalmologic disease and leading cause of blindness. A retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate resources and costs for end-stage glaucoma patients receiving visual rehabilitation care (VRC). Materials and Methods: A chart review was conducted in 3 United States VRC centers. Charts of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma as the primary cause of vision loss (1998 to 2003) were selected, yielding 81 records. Data were collected from patient-level billing and reimbursement records (ophthalmologist/optometrist visits, glaucoma medications, procedures, and specialized low-vision and glaucoma-related services). Visual rehabilitation services included utilization of low-vision devices, assessment of daily functioning, orientation and mobility training, and patient counseling. Results: Mean age at baseline was 72.7 years [standard deviation (SD) = 17.2, range: 29 to 95]. Of those with known sex (n = 77), 55.8% were women. Medicare was the payer type for most patients (59.3%), whereas 20% had Medicaid. Mean number of visits was 7.1 (SD = 6.1) in year 1 and 3.7 (SD = 4.2) in year 2, for an annual mean of 5.4 (SD = 5.0) visits overall. Total mean cost per patient in year I was greater than year 2 [$2170 (SD = $2252) vs. $1202 (SD = $1080), respectively]; of the total 2-year costs, 15% were VRC, 37% ophthalmology care, and 48% pharmacy. Analysis of nonpharmacy costs revealed that VRC accounted for 28% and ophthalmology for 72%. Conclusions: End-stage glaucoma is associated with appreciable resource utilization and costs, because of both vision rehabilitation and ophthalmology care. Advanced primary open-angle glaucoma has a substantial cost-of-illness, warranting improved management in early stages of disease.},

The variational Bayesian independent component analysis mixture model (vB-ICA-mm) partitioned the SAP fields into the most informative number of clusters. Simultaneously, it learned an optimal number of maximally independent axes for each cluster. The most informative number of clusters was two. vB-ICA-mm placed 68.6% of the SAP fields from eyes with GON in a cluster labeled G and 98.4% of the fields from eyes with normal optic discs in a cluster labeled N. Cluster G optimally contained six axes. Post hoc analysis of patterns generated at -1 SD and +2 SD from the cluster G mean on the six axes revealed defects similar to those identified by experts as indicative of glaucoma. SAP fields associated with an axis showed increasing severity as they were located farther in the positive direction from the cluster G mean. vB-ICA-mm represented the SAP fields with patterns that were meaningful for glaucoma experts.

The authors evaluated the reliability of the trained neural networks to discriminate between normal eyes and eyes with glaucoma. Methods. Inclusion criteria for glaucomatous and normal eyes were the intraocular pressure and the appearance of the optic nerve; previous visual fields were not used. The authors compared the backpropagation learning method used by automated neural networks to those used by two specialists in glaucoma to classify the central 24 degrees automated perimetric visual fields from 60 normal and 60 glaucomatous eyes. Results. The glaucoma experts and a trained two-layered network were each correct at approximately 67%. The average sensitivity of this test was 59% for the two glaucoma specialists and 65% for the two-layered network. The corresponding specificities were 74% and 71% for the specialists and the two-layered network, respectively. The experts and the network were in agreement about 74% of the time, which indicated no significant disagreement between the methods of testing. Feature analysis with a one-layered network determined the most important visual field positions. Conclusions. The authors conclude that a neural network can be taught to be as proficient as a trained reader in interpreting visual fields for glaucoma.},

To determine which machine learning classifier learns best to interpret standard automated perimetry (SAP) and to compare the best of the machine classifiers with the global indices of STATPAC 2 and with experts in glaucoma. METHODS. Multilayer perceptrons (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), mixture of Gaussian (MoG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG) classifiers were trained and tested by cross validation on the numerical plot of absolute sensitivity plus age of 189 normal eves and 156 glaucomatous eves, designated as such by the appearance of the optic nerve. The authors compared performance of these classifiers with the global indices of STATPAC, using the area under the ROC curve. Two human experts were judged against the machine classifiers and the global indices by plotting their sensitivity specificity pairs. RESULTS. MoG had the greatest area under the ROC curve of the machine classifiers. Pattern SD (PSD) and corrected PSD (CPSD) had the largest areas under the curve of the global indices. MoG had significantly greater ROC area than PSD and CPSD. Human experts were not better at classifying visual fields than the machine classifiers or the global indices. CONCLUSIONS. MoG, using the entire visual field and age for input, interpreted SAP better than the global indices of STATPAC. Machine classifiers may augment the global indices of STATPAC.},

SITA fields were obtained with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, California) on 1,146 normal eyes and 939 glaucoma eyes from subjects followed by the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study and the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. VIM modifies independent component analysis (ICA) to develop separate sets of ICA axes in the cluster of normal fields and the 2 clusters of abnormal fields. Of 360 models, the model with the best separation of normal and glaucomatous fields was chosen for creating the maximally independent axes. Grayscale displays of fields generated by VIM on each axis were compared. SITA fields most closely associated with each axis and displayed in grayscale were evaluated for consistency of pattern at all severities. The best VIM model had 3 clusters. Cluster 1 (1,193) was mostly normal (1,089, 95% specificity) and had 2 axes. Cluster 2 (596) contained mildly abnormal fields (513) and 2 axes; cluster 3 (323) held mostly moderately to severely abnormal fields (322) and 5 axes. Sensitivity for clusters 2 and 3 combined was 88.9%. The VIM-generated field patterns differed from each other and resembled glaucomatous defects (eg, nasal step, arcuate, temporal wedge). SITA fields assigned to an axis resembled each other and the VIM-generated patterns for that axis. Pattern severity increased in the positive direction of each axis by expansion or deepening of the axis pattern. VIM worked well on SITA fields, separating them into distinctly different yet recognizable patterns of glaucomatous field defects. The axis and pattern properties make VIM a good candidate as a preliminary process for detecting progression. },

  abstract =    {Background/aims: To determine the structure-function relationship throughout the different stages of glaucoma. Methods: Subjects: 228 controls and 1007 suspected, early, moderate, or advanced glaucomas. In controls, Pearson coefficient of variation (PCV) of standard automated perimetry mean sensitivity (SAP-MS) and global mean retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFL, Heidelberg Retina Tomograph) were calculated. Piecewise linear regression was used to evaluate if the data were related better to two separate regression lines in all population. Results: PCV for SAP-MS and RNFL was 6.19% and 29.27%, respectively. For SAP-MS.22.42 dB (piecewise linear regression-obtained breakpoint, p<0.05), the logarithmic and linear relationships between SAP-MS and mean RNFL thickness were not different (r = 0.182, r = 0.185 respectively; p = 0.950). For SAP-MS<22.42 dB, the logarithmic and linear relationships between SAP-MS and mean RNFL thickness were not different (r = 0.353, r = 0.344 respectively; p = 0.884). Conclusion: The logarithmic and linear relationships between SAP-MS and mean RNFL thickness did not differ when individuals were stratified using the piecewise linear regression-obtained cut-off point. The curvilinear relationship between the morphological and perimetric results may be due to the wide variability in normal morphology and limitations in the dynamic range of the morphological tests in cases with moderate and severe defects.},

  abstract =    {The glaucomas are a group of relatively common optic neuropathies, in which the pathological loss of retinal ganglion cells causes a progressive loss of sight and associated alterations in the retinal nerve fiber layer and optic nerve head. The diagnosis and management of glaucoma are often dependent on methods of clinical testing that either, 1) identify and quantify patterns of functional visual abnormality, or 2) quantify structural abnormality in the retinal nerve fiber layer, both of which are caused by loss of retinal ganglion cells. Although it is evident that the abnormalities in structure and function should be correlated, propositions to link losses in structure and function in glaucoma have been formulated only recently. The present report describes an attempt to build a model of these linking propositions using data from investigations of the relationships between losses of visual sensitivity and thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer over progressive stages of glaucoma severity. A foundation for the model was laid through the pointwise relationships between visual sensitivities (behavioral perimetry in monkeys with experimental glaucoma) and histological analyses of retinal ganglion cell densities in corresponding retinal locations. The subsequent blocks of the model were constructed from clinical studies of aging in normal human subjects and of clinical glaucoma in patients to provide a direct comparison of the results from standard clinical perimetry and optical coherence tomography. The final formulation is a nonlinear structure function model that was evaluated by the accuracy and precision of translating visual sensitivities in a region of the visual field to produce a predicted thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer in the peripapillary sector that corresponded to the region of reduced visual sensitivity. The model was tested on two independent patient populations, with results that confirmed the predictive relationship between the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and visual sensitivities from clinical perimetry. Thus, the proposed model for linking structure and function in glaucoma has provided information that is important in understanding the results of standard clinical testing and the neuronal losses caused by glaucoma, which may have clinical application for inter-test comparisons of the stage of disease.

The maps show a continuum of change as one moves across them with early loss at one corner and advanced loss at the opposite corner.

We develop measures of both diffuse and localized defects in the visual field as potential predictors of glaucoma.

The best measures of diffuse loss include a field's mean level, contrasts of the upper and lower halves, and contrasts of the nasal and temporal halves, Local loss is measured by the depth, area, volume and location of the field's largest defect. We develop logistic regression models to classify eyes as having glaucoma or not. We present ROC curves of the results that are highly competitive with current clinical methods of classification.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To study the correlation between local perimetric field defects and glaucoma-induced thickness reduction of the nerve layer measured in the peripapillary area with scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SOCT) and to compare the results with those of a theoretical model. METHODS. The thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer was determined in 32 sectors (11.25 each) by using SLP with variable cornea compensation (GDxVCC; Laser Diagnostics, San Diego, CA) and the newly introduced high-resolution SOCT (Spectralis; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Eighty-eight healthy subjects served as control subjects, to determine the thickness deviation in patients with glaucoma. The relationship between glaucomatous nerve fiber reduction and visual field losses was calculated in six nerve fiber bundle-related areas. Sixty-four patients at different stages of open-angle glaucoma and 26 patients with ocular hypertension underwent perimetry (Octopus G1; Haag-Streit, Koniz, Switzerland) and measurements with the two morphometric techniques. RESULTS. Sector-shaped analyses between local perimetric losses and reduction of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness showed a significant association for corresponding areas except for the central visual field in SLP. Correlation coefficients were highest in the area of the nasal inferior visual field ( SOCT, -0.81; SLP, -0.57). A linear model describes the association between structural and functional damage. CONCLUSIONS. Localized perimetric defects can be explained by reduced nerve fiber layer thickness. The data indicate that the present SOCT is useful for determining the functional-structural relationship in peripapillary areas and that association between perimetric defects and corresponding nerve fiber losses is stronger for SOCT than for the present SLP.

To develop and compare the ability of several automated classifiers to differentiate between normal and glaucomatous eyes based on the quantitative assessment of summary data reports from Stratus optical coherence tomography (OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA) in a Chinese population in Taiwan. METHODS. One randomly selected eye from each of 89 patients with glaucoma and each of 100 age- and sex-matched normal individuals were included in the study. Measurements of glaucoma variables ( retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and optic nerve head analysis results) were obtained by Stratus OCT. With the Stratus OCT parameters used as input, receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curves were generated by three methods, to classify eyes as either glaucomatous or normal: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Mahalanobis distance ( MD), and artificial neural network ( ANN). The area under the ROC curve was optimized by principal component analysis (PCA). Classification accuracy was determined by cross validation. RESULTS. The average visual field mean deviation was - 0.7 +/- 0.6 dB in the normal group and - 2.7 +/- 1.9 dB in the glaucoma group. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.824 ( LDA), 0.849 ( MD), 0.821 ( ANN), 0.915 ( LDA with PCA), 0.991 ( MD with PCA), and 0.874 ( ANN with PCA). CONCLUSIONS. With Stratus OCT parameters used as input, automated classifiers show promise for discriminating between glaucomatous and normal eyes. MD measured from multivariate data can predict the severity of glaucoma through the construction of a measurement space. After PCA, implementation results show that the Mahalanobis space created by MD surpasses LDA and ANN in diagnosing glaucoma.},

The aim of this modeling is to solve various significant medical problems, namely the forecasting of future observations, the classification of observations as normal or defective, and the simulation of new longitudinal data sets. In order to ascertain whether a patient suffers from glaucoma, a perimetry is performed. The output of a perimetry is called a visual field and consists of a map with 52 numerical values plotted on a regular grid. In this work, a data set of healthy patients' visual fields is used. The work begins with an exploratory spatial data analysis. A semi-parametric approach is used to model the mean, and the variogram is fitted using a Matern function. Once the spatial structure has been analysed, the spatial mean is subtracted from all the observations in the data set and the spatio-temporal correlation of the residuals is explored. All this information is used to build a space-time model, the parameters of which are estimated by maximum likelihood. Different methods are used to check the goodness of fit.},

Methods: Literature searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were conducted last on May 7, 2010, and were restricted to citations published on or after January 1, 1994. The search yielded 1063 unique citations. The first author reviewed the titles and abstracts of these articles and selected 185 of possible clinical relevance for further review. The panel members reviewed the full text of these articles and determined that 85 met inclusion criteria. They conducted data abstraction of the 85 studies, and the panel methodologist assigned a level of evidence to each of the selected articles. One study was rated as level I evidence. The remaining articles were classified broadly as providing level II evidence. Studies deemed to provide level III evidence were not included in the assessment. Results: Standard white-on-white automated perimetry remains the most commonly performed test for assessing the visual field, with the Swedish interactive threshold algorithm (SITA) largely replacing full-threshold testing strategies. Frequency-doubling technology and its refinement into Matrix perimetry, as well as short-wavelength automated perimetry, now available with SITA, have been evaluated extensively. Machine learning classifiers seem to be ready for incorporation into software to help distinguish glaucomatous from nonglauco-matous fields. Other technologies, such as multifocal visual-evoked potential and electroretinography, which were designed as objective measures of visual function, provide testing free of patient input, but issues prevent their adoption for glaucoma management. Conclusions: Advances in technology and analytic tools over the past decade have provided us with more rapid and varied ways of assessing visual function in glaucoma, but they have yet to produce definitive guidance on the diagnosis of glaucoma or its progression over time. Further research on an objective measure of visual function is needed. Financial Disclosure(s): Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references.

DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study. METHODS: Three populations were evaluated: (1) 348 normal subjects (348 eyes) were tested to develop nor, mative databases and statistical analysis packages for SAP and SWAP. (2) An independent group of 47 normal subjects (94 eyes) with 4 years of longitudinal follow-up was evaluated to determine specificity of different criteria. (3) A group of 298 patients (479 eyes) with elevated intraocular pressure and normal baseline SAP visual fields were evaluated to determine the sensitivity of different criteria for detecting early glaucomatous visual field loss. RESULTS: Six criteria demonstrated high specificity for correctly identifying eyes with normal visual fields (98%-100%) for both SAP and SWAP: (1) a pattern standard deviation (PSD) worse than the normal 1% level, (2) a glaucoma hemifield test (GHT) "outside normal limits," (3) one hemifield cluster worse than the normal 1% level, (4) two hemifield clusters worse than the normal 5% level, (5) four abnormal (P < .05) locations, (6) five abnormal locations (P < .05) on the pattern deviation probability plot. For all criteria, confirmation on a second visual field was required for high specificity. The GHT "outside normal limits," two hemi. field clusters worse than the normal 5% level and four abnormal (P < .05) test locations on the pattern deviation probability plot provided the highest percentages of conversion from a normal to a glaucomatous visual field. CONCLUSIONS: Criteria based on the GHT, GHT hemifield clusters, and the pattern deviation probability plot provide high sensitivity and specificity for detecting early glaucomatous visual field changes.

DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: Patients with elevated intraocular pressure and normal SAP visual fields were enrolled in this prospective study. Stereo optic disk photographs, SAP, and SWAP visual fields were obtained annually over a period of 4 or more years. Trained readers evaluated baseline and follow,up optic disk photographs for evidence of glaucomatous damage. Standard automated perimetry and SWAP examinations were evaluated according to previously validated criteria for development of confirmed visual field changes. RESULTS: Two-hundred ninety,five subjects (479 eyes) were enrolled. Following masked assessment of stereo photographs by an optic disk reading center, 272 of the 479 eyes were judged to have glaucomatous optic neuropathy at the time of study entry. Depending on the criteria employed, approximately 10% to 17.5% of all eyes developed confirmed visual field loss for SAP (conversions). Of the conversions, 75% to 80% had baseline glaucomatous optic disk damage, whereas normal and glaucomatous optic disks were equally divided (50%) among the nonconversion eyes. This difference was statistically significant (P <.003). Depending on the criteria employed, 4% to 12% of the eyes had confirmed SWAP deficits at baseline, and 4% to 8% developed confirmed SWAP defects at a follow-up examination. There was a greater percentage of eyes with a glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the group with SWAP deficits (75%-100%) than for those eyes in which SWAP remained normal (45 %- 60%). Some of these differences were statistically significant (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: A strong relationship exists between glaucomatous optic disk damage at study entry and the subsequent development of a confirmed glaucomatous SAP visual field defect. A higher percentage of glaucomatous optic disks were also found in patients with SWAP deficits at baseline and in those who later developed SWAP deficits. These findings support the premise that a glaucomatous optic disk is predictive of the subsequent development of glaucomatous visual field loss. (C) 2003 by Elsevier Science Inc.

Main Outcome Measures: Mean difference in scores 1 year apart and the variance of these differences were measured, Results: The median scores for the first of the two fields was 5.2 (interquartile range [IQR] = 9.8) for CIGTS and 5.0 (IQR = 7.0) for AGIS. The CIGTS scores were slightly larger than AGIS scores by an average of 0.5 (P = 0.06). The mean CIGTS score of the baseline fields was 0.06 (standard deviation = 3.8) higher than the mean of the second fields and 0.12 (standard deviation = 2.8) higher for AGIS, Fifteen percent of eyes had CIGTS scores that deteriorated by three or more (the cutoff for unconfirmed progression) over 1 year, while 7.5% of eyes had AGIS scores that deteriorated by four or more (the AGIS cutoff for unconfirmed progression) over the same period. Twenty-one percent improved by CIGTS criteria, while 12% improved by AGIS criteria. Conclusions: CIGTS scores are systematically slightly higher than AGIS scores. The CIGTS scoring system has higher temporal variability than the AGIS system. The CIGTS criterion for unconfirmed progression over a 1-year period is likely to lead to higher estimated rates of progression than the AGIS criteria. This is mostly because of the difference in the definition of progression between the two study criteria.},

The examination is disguised as a game to maintain the patient's attention and uses speech synthesis to issue instructions and encouragement. Clinical studies show that CAMEC provides comparable results to more expensive perimeters and is also successful in children as young as five years who cannot be examined by other methods. A neural network has been used to classify visual field data in the CAMEC format. This has the potential to provide self-testing diagnostic visual field examinations without the presence of skilled clinical personnel. A three-layer back propagation network was designed, with 110 units in the input layer, each unit corresponding to a test point on the CAMEC grid, a hidden layer of 40 units and an output layer of 22 units, each one corresponding to a particular type of visual field defect. Four hundred and ninety simulated field plots were generated in the CAMEC format by experienced ophthalmologists. These data were split into a training sets of 440 plots and a test set of 50 plots. Training of the neural network was accomplished by cycling the training set up to 50000 times through the network. The effect of changing the number of hidden units was investigated using the test set of field plots. Optimizing the network configuration results in a classification accuracy of 98.2% for the training set of data and 96% for the test set.},

Methods: Follow-up VFs are performed every 6 months and are monitored for abnormality, indicated by a glaucoma hemifield test result or a corrected pattern SD outside the normal limits. As of January 1, 2002, 1636 patients had 2509 abnormal VFs. Three readers independently classified each hemifield using a classification system developed at the VF reading center. A subset (50%) of the abnormal VFs was reread to evaluate test-retest reader agreement. A mean deviation was calculated separately for the hemifields as an index to the severity of VF loss. Main Outcome Measures: A 97% interreader hemifield agreement. Results: The average hemifield classification agreement (between any 2 of 3 readers) for 5018 hemifields was 97% and 88% for the 1266 abnormal VFs that were reread (agreement between the first and second classifications). Glaucomatous patterns of loss (partial arcuate, paracentral, and nasal step defects) composed the majority of VF defects. Conclusion: The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study classification system has high reproducibility and provides a possible nomenclature for characterizing VF defects.},

  abstract =    {Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate what treatment strategies prevail in different countries for patients newly diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OH) only and initiated on treatment with beta-blockers, and to estimate the total direct cost of treatment for two years. In addition, differences in costs between and within the countries and the determinants of variations in costs across patients were examined. Materials and Methods: The authors performed a retrospective medical record analysis in several academic and office-based study centers in Sweden and the United States. Standard costs for each resource item were determined and applied to all centers within the country. Differences in treatment costs within the countries are thus the effect of differences in treatment strategies, not of differences in prices. Results: There was considerable variation between the centers of each country. Sweden had a higher number of surgical interventions, which may be explained by the fact that the Swedish cohort had a higher mean intraocular pressure (IOP) at baseline and a higher proportion of patients with definite POAG and exfoliation glaucoma. However, in both countries the mean IOP at study end was approximately 18 mm Hg. Total direct costs for two years were 15,119 SEK (US$2,160; $1US = 7 SEK) and $2,109, respectively. In a multiple regression analysis, the estimated effects of baseline IOP and of IOP change after treatment initiation on treatment costs were positively and negatively significant, respectively, in both countries. Conclusion: Despite differences in baseline diagnosis and in treatment strategies, mean IOP was decreased to 18 mm Hg in both countries. Baseline IOP was positively correlated with treatment costs, while the initial IOP-lowering effect of treatment was negatively correlated with two-year costs.},

  abstract =    {Background: Brusini's recently introduced glaucoma staging system (GSS) categorizes visual-field damages into different types (i.e. generalized, mixed and localized) and classifies them into stages similar to those of Aulhorn-Karmeyer. Basically, the Brusini GSS is a scatterplot of mean defect (x-axis) and corrected loss variance (CLV; y-axis). The Brusini GSS charts are claimed to be simple to understand due to their 2-dimensional spatial representation and there is no subjective interpretation necessary, since their numerical presentation provides an objective evaluation. Inter-and intraindividual comparisons are, thus, provided 'at a glance'. Methods: Retrospectively, 610 visual fields (Octopus 201, Program G1) for each eye of 32 glaucoma patients were inspected on screen with PeriData 7.0. The performance of the Brusini GSS was evaluated in terms of typing of visual-field defect and staging as defined by the Aulhorn-Karmeyer classification. Results: Typing of defects into 'normal' and various degrees of generalized and localized damage agreed with PeriData in 89% of fields; 5% were wrongly classified as normal by the Brusini GSS. The type of visual defect showed in 1.3% fields as marked and in 5% a minor discrepancy. Most of the 11% of nonagreement was due to high short-term fluctuation. Agreement could potentially be enhanced by using loss variance instead of CLV Staging of visual-field defects with Brusini GSS charts was in agreement with the Aulhorn-Karmeyer classification in 73% of fields. Conclusion: The authors recommend the Brusini GSS because of its simplicity to concisely describe visual-field damage for clinical use as well as research work and because of the remarkably good agreement with the well-known Aulhorn-Karmeyer classification.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE: To assess the agreement of parapapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements among 3 spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) instruments. DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional study. METHODS: Three hundred thirty eyes (88 with glaucoma, 206 glaucoma suspects, 36 healthy) from 208 individuals enrolled in the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS) were imaged using RTVue, Spectralis and Cirrus in a single visit. Agreement among RNFL thickness measurements was assessed using Bland-Altman plots. The influence of age, axial length, disc size, race, spherical equivalent, and disease severity on the pairwise agreements between different instruments was assessed by regression analysis. RESULTS: Although RNFL thickness measurements between different instruments were highly correlated, Bland-Altman analyses indicated the presence of fixed and proportional biases for most of the pairwise agreements. In general, RTVue measurements tended to be thicker than Spectra lis and Cirrus measurements. The agreement in average RNFL thickness measurements between RTVue and Spectra lis was affected by age (P = .001) and spherical equivalent (P < .001), whereas the agreement between Spectralis and Cirrus was affected by axial length (P = .004) and spherical equivalent (P < .001). Disease severity influenced the agreement between Spectralis and both RTVue and Cirrus (P = .001). Disc area and race did not influence the agreement among the devices. CONCLUSIONS: RNFL thickness measurements obtained by different SD-OCT instruments were not entirely compatible and therefore they should not be used interchangeably. This may be attributable in part to differences in RNFL detection algorithms. Comparisons with histologic measurements could determine which technique is most accurate.

Design: Diagnostic, case-control study. Participants: A total of 233 (107 healthy, 126 glaucomatous) of 149 participants from the longitudinal Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS) and from the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study (ADAGES). Methods: All participants underwent RNFL thickness imaging with the Spectralis, Cirrus, and RTVue devices in the same visit. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves adjusted for age and race were obtained for quadrants (superior, nasal, inferior, temporal) and global RNFL thickness for all instruments. Areas under ROC (AUC) and sensitivities at fixed specificities (80% and 95%) were calculated and compared. Main Outcome Measures: Comparison of diagnostic accuracy using AUCs and sensitivities at fixed specificities of 80% and 95%. Results: The RNFL thickness parameter with the largest AUCs was the superior quadrant for the Spectralis (0.88) and the global RNFL thickness for the Cirrus (0.88) and the RTVue (0.87). The pairwise comparison among the ROC curves showed no statistical difference for all parameters except for the nasal quadrant, which had significantly larger AUC in the Spectralis and RTVue compared with the Cirrus (P < 0.03 for both comparisons). There were no significant differences in sensitivities among the best parameters from each instrument (P > 0.05). The superior quadrant thickness measured with the Spectralis had sensitivity of 81.9% at a fixed specificity of 80% and 70% at a fixed specificity of 95%. The global thickness measured by the Cirrus had a sensitivity of 80.3% at a fixed specificity of 80% and 65.6% at a fixed specificity of 95%. For the RTVue, the global thickness had a sensitivity of 77.9% at a fixed specificity of 80% and 62.1% at a fixed specificity of 95%.

All eyes underwent testing with the Cirrus SDOCT and SAP within a 6-month period. The relationship between parapapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) sectors and corresponding topographic SAP locations was evaluated using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing and regression analysis. SAP sensitivity values were evaluated using both linear as well as logarithmic scales. We also tested the fit of a model (Hood) for structure-function relationship in glaucoma. Results: Structure was significantly related to function for all but the nasal thickness sector. The relationship was strongest for superotemporal RNFL thickness and inferonasal sensitivity (R(2) = 0.314, P < 0.001). The Hood model fitted the data relatively well with 88% of the eyes inside the 95% confidence interval predicted by the model.

Its secondary aims are to explore factors related to glaucoma progression and to study the natural history of the disease. This article describes the EMGT design and presents baseline data. Design: Randomized, clinical trial. Participants: Newly diagnosed patients 50 to 80 years of age with early glaucomatous visual field defects were mainly identified from a population-based screening of more than 44,000 residents of Malmo and Helsingborg, Sweden. Exclusion criteria were advanced visual field loss; mean IOP greater than 30 mmHg or any IOP greater than 35 mmHg; visual acuity less than 0.5; and inability to complete follow-up protocols. Interventions: After informed consent, patients were randomized to treatment or no initial treatment with close follow-up. Treated patients had laser trabeculoplasty and started receiving topical betaxolol twice daily in eligible eyes. Follow-up visits include computerized perimetry and tonometry every 3 months and fundus photography every 6 months. Decisions to change or begin treatment are made jointly with the patient when EMGT progression occurs and also later if clinically needed. Main Outcome Measures: The EMGT progression is defined by sustained increases of visual field loss in three consecutive C30-2 Humphrey tests, as determined from computer-based analyses, or by optic disc changes, as determined from flicker chronoscopy and side-by-side comparisons of fundus photographs performed by masked, independent graders. Results: A total of 255 patients were randomized between 1993 and 1997 and will be followed for at least 4 years. All had generally good health status; mean age was 68.1 years, and 66% were women. At baseline, mean IOP was 20.6 mmHg and 80% of eyes had IOP less than 25 mmHg, Conclusions: The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial is the first large randomized, clinical trial to evaluate the role of immediate pressure reduction, as compared to no initial reduction, in patients with early glaucoma and normal or moderately elevated IOP, Its results will have implications for: (1) the clinical management of glaucoma; (2) understanding the role of IOP and the natural history of glaucoma; and (3) evaluating the rationale for glaucoma screening.},

Design: Prospective study. Participants: One hundred eight eyes of 70 glaucoma patients. Methods: Patients were followed up every 4 months for at least 2.9 years (median, 3.2 years) for measurement of RNFL thickness with the Stratus optical coherence tomograph (OCT) (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA), neuroretinal rim area with the Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph (HRT 3; Heidelberg Engineering, GmbH, Dossen-heim, Germany), and visual field with the Humphrey Field Analyzer II (Carl Zeiss Meditec). Linear regression analyses were performed between visual field index (VFI), RNFL, and neuroretinal rim measurements and age, with progression defined when a significant negative trend was detected. The agreement among structural and functional measurements was evaluated with kappa statistics. The mean rate of change was estimated with linear mixed modeling. Main Outcome Measures: The agreement on progression detection and the rate of change of RNFL, neuroretinal rim, and VFI measurements. Results: A total of 1105 OCT, 1062 HRT, and 1099 visual field measurements were analyzed. The agreement of progression detection among the 3 investigations was poor (kappa <= 0.09). Ten eyes (9.3%; 9 patients) showed progression by average RNFL thickness, 16 (14.8%; 14 patients) by global neuroretinal rim area, and 35 (32.4%; 31 patients) by VFI. Only 1 eye (0.9%) had progression detected by all 3 methods. There were large variations in the rate of change of VFI, average RNFL thickness, and global neuroretinal rim area, with a range between -0.63% and -4.97% per year, -2.32% and -10.12% per year, and -0.61% and -8.48% per year, respectively. The respective mean rate estimates were -1.15% per year (95% confidence interval [ CI], -1.56% to -0.73%), -0.70% per year (95% CI, -1.19% to -0.21%), and -1.06% per year (95% CI, -1.56% to -0.55%). Conclusions: The agreement of progression detection among RNFL, neuroretinal rim, and visual field measurements was poor, and the rate of RNFL, neuroretinal rim, and visual field progression varied considerably within and between subjects. Given this variability, interpretation of RNFL, neuroretinal rim, and VFI progression always should be evaluated on an individual basis.

  abstract =    {PURPOSE: To assess the noneconomic value of tests used in the diagnosis and management of glaucoma, and explore the contexts and factors that determine such value. DESIGN: Perspective. METHODS: Selected articles from primary and secondary sources were reviewed and interpreted in the context of the authors' clinical and research experience, influenced by our perspectives on the tasks of reducing the global problem of irreversible blindness caused by glaucoma. The value of any test used in glaucoma is addressed by 3 questions regarding: its contexts, its kind of value, and its implicit or explicit benefits. RESULTS: Tonometry, slit-lamp gonioscopy, and optic disc evaluation remain the foundation of clinic-based case finding, whether in areas of more or less abundant resources. In resource-poor areas, there is urgency in identifying patients at risk for severe functional loss of vision; screening strategies have proven ineffective, and efforts are hindered by the inadequate allocation of support. In resource-abundant areas, the wider spectrum of glaucoma is addressed, with emphasis on early detection of structural changes of little functional consequence; these are increasingly the focus of new and expensive technologies whose clinical value has not been established in longitudinal and population-based studies. These contrasting realities in part reflect differences among the value ascribed, often implicitly, to the tests used in glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: The value of any test is determined by 3 aspects: its context of usage; its comparative worth and to whom its benefit accrues; and how we define historically what we are testing. These multiple factors should be considered in the elaboration of priorities for the development and application of tests in glaucoma. (Am J Ophthalmol 2011;152:889-899. (C) 2011 by Elsevier Inc.

The receiver operating characteristics of the network then were compared with the previously determined performance of other algorithms on the same data set. Results: At a specificity greater than 90%, the neural network was more sensitive than any of the available algorithms (although only the global indices were available for comparison, as the cluster and cross-meridional algorithms did not achieve such high specificity at their current settings). At a lower specificity (80-85%), the neural network was unable to attain the high sensitivity of the cluster or cross-meridional algorithms; in fact, the cluster algorithm from the Low-Tension Glaucoma study was significantly more sensitive. Conclusion: The receiver operating characteristics of a feed-forward neural network designed to detect visual field defects were explored. At a very high specificity (90-95%) a neural network performed better than the global indices.

The amplitude spectra of the perimeter's 10-2 fields (model 511 Humphrey Field Analyser [HFA]; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., North Ryde, NSW, Australia) were assessed to see whether their finer grained sampling revealed spatial frequencies that could cause distortions of standard fields because of undersampling. Model visual fields were then constructed whose spectra were similar to the 10-2 fields, and test-retest variability was examined for Goldmann sizes III to VI stimuli and Gaussian fixational drift with standard deviations of 0.075 degrees to 0.3 degrees. RESULTS. The 10-2 fields showed significant spatial frequency content up to 0.25 cyc/deg, three times the highest frequency that a 30-2 or 24-2 sample grid can resolve. As reported for SAP, test-retest variability increased with scotoma depth, and increasing the stimulus size from III to VI caused a reduction in test-retest variability, as did reduced fixation jitter. CONCLUSIONS. With fixation drift half the size of that exhibited by good fixators, many of the features of SAP test-retest variability were reproduced. Reducing test-retest variability may therefore involve using large test stimuli that are blurry in appearance and that overlap somewhat when placed on the perimetric test grid. Overlap across the meridians should perhaps be avoided. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2011; 52:1014-1022) DOI:10.1167/iovs.10-6014},

  abstract =    {We used a statistical cluster analysis to analyze patterns of loss in 76 visual fields with typical glaucomatous defects to identify natural groupings of test locations in the visual field. Eleven clusters in the Octopus Program G1 (Interzeag, Inc., Northboro, Massachusetts) visual field were thus defined. In a separate population of 70 early glaucomatous and 70 age-matched normal visual fields, the local mean defects within these clusters and the global mean defect were calculated to assess their relative abilities to discriminate between the two groups. The 11 clustered mean defects collectively had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 93%; the global mean defect had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 91%. Additionally, we examined the long-term fluctuation clusters of test locations compared to the long-term fluctuation of individual test locations. Four hundred ten visual fields of 93 clinically stable eyes of 67 patients with glaucoma, as well as 210 visual fields of 105 eyes of 105 normal subjects were studied. In the stable glaucoma group, mean fluctuation of clustered test locations was 3.5 dB(2), and mean fluctuation of individual test locations was 7.0 dB(2). In the normal group, the respective values were 0.6 dB(2) and 1.8 dB(2). Cluster analysis was effective in detecting localized loss and in dampening long-term fluctuation, We studied the use of clusters in distinguishing normal from glaucomatous as well as stable from deteriorating visual fields.},

  abstract =    {Objective: To evaluate the ability of progressive optic disc damage detected by assessment of longitudinal stereophotographs to predict future development of functional loss in those with suspected glaucoma. Methods: The study included 639 eyes of 407 patients with suspected glaucoma followed up for an average of 8.0 years with annual standard automated perimetry visual field and optic disc stereophotographs. All patients had normal and reliable standard automated perimetry results at baseline. Conversion to glaucoma was defined as development of 3 consecutive abnormal visual fields during follow-up. Presence of progressive optic disc damage was evaluated by grading longitudinally acquired simultaneous stereophotographs. Other predictive factors included age, intraocular pressure, central corneal thickness, pattern standard deviation, and baseline stereophotograph grading. Hazard ratios for predicting visual field loss were obtained by extended Cox models, with optic disc progression as a time-dependent covariate. Predictive accuracy was evaluated using a modified R(2) index. Results: Progressive optic disc damage had a hazard ratio of 25.8 (95% confidence interval, 16.0-41.7) and was the most important risk factor for development of visual field loss with an R(2) of 79%. The R(2)S for other predictive factors ranged from 6% to 26%. Conclusions: Presence of progressive optic disc damage on stereophotographs was a highly predictive factor for future development of functional loss in glaucoma. These findings suggest the importance of careful monitoring of the optic disc appearance and a potential role for longitudinal assessment of the optic disc as an end point in clinical trials and as a reference for evaluation of diagnostic tests in glaucoma.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To present and evaluate a new methodology for combining longitudinal information from structural and functional tests to improve detection of glaucoma progression and estimation of rates of change. METHODS. This observational cohort study included 434 eyes of 257 participants observed for an average of 4.2 +/- 1.1 years and recruited from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS). The subjects were examined annually with standard automated perimetry, optic disc stereophotographs, and scanning laser polarimetry with enhanced corneal compensation. Rates of change over time were measured using the visual field index (VFI) and average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (TSNIT average). A Bayesian hierarchical model was built to integrate information from the longitudinal measures and classify individual eyes as progressing or not. Estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the Bayesian method were compared with those obtained by the conventional approach of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression. RESULTS. The Bayesian method identified a significantly higher proportion of the 405 glaucomatous and suspect eyes as having progressed when compared with the OLS method (22.7% vs. 12.8%; P < 0.001), while having the same specificity of 100% in 29 healthy eyes. In addition, the Bayesian method identified a significantly higher proportion of eyes with progression by optic disc stereophotographs compared with the OLS method (74% vs. 37%; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. A Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach for combining functional and structural tests performed significantly better than the OLS method for detection of glaucoma progression.

  abstract =    {Background: Visual field testing is an essential part of glaucoma care. It is hampered by variability related to the disease itself, response errors and fatigue. In glaucoma, blind parts of the visual field contribute to the diagnosis but - once established - not to progression detection; they only increase testing time. The aims of this study were to describe the persistence and spatial distribution of blind test locations in standard automated perimetry in glaucoma and to explore how the omission of presumed blind test locations would affect progression detection. Methodology/Principal Findings: Data from 221 eyes of 221 patients from a cohort study with the Humphrey Field Analyzer with 30-2 grid were used. Patients were stratified according to baseline mean deviation (MD) in six strata of 5 dB width each. For one, two, three and four consecutive <0 dB sensitivities in the same test location in a series of baseline tests, the median probabilities to observe <0 dB again in the concerning test location in a follow-up test were 76, 86, 88 and 90%, respectively. For <10 dB, the probabilities were 88, 95, 97 and 98%, respectively. Median (interquartile range) percentages of test locations with three consecutive <0 dB sensitivities were 0(0-0), 0(0-2), 4(0-9), 17(8-27), 27(20-40) and 60(50-70)% for the six MD strata. Similar percentages were found for a subset of test locations within 10 degree eccentricity (P>0.1 for all strata). Omitting test locations with three consecutive <0 dB sensitivities at baseline did not affect the performance of the MD-based Nonparametric Progression Analysis progression detection algorithm. Conclusions/Significance: Test locations that have been shown to be reproducibly blind tend to display a reasonable blindness persistence and do no longer contribute to progression detection. There is no clinically useful universal MD cut-off value beyond which testing can be limited to 10 degree eccentricity.},

Design: Randomized, controlled clinical trial. Participants: A total of 607 patients with open-angle glaucoma were enrolled. Intervention: Patients randomized to initial medications (n=307) received a stepped regimen of medications to lower intraocular pressure. Those randomized to initial surgery (n=300) underwent trabeculectomy to lower intraocular pressure. Main Outcome Measures: Progression in visual field loss constitutes the study's primary outcome variable. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, visual acuity, and intraocular pressure. Results: Randomized assignment resulted in a balanced distribution between treatment groups for most demographic and clinical measures assessed at enrollment. More males than females were enrolled (55% were males), and a substantial percentage (38.1 %) of enrollees were blacks. Most enrollees (90.6%) were diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma; the remainder had either pseudoexfoliative (4.8%) or pigmentary (4.6%) forms of open-angle glaucoma. Conclusions: Follow-up of this well-characterized group of patients should provide well-rounded guidance, based on both traditional ophthalmic measures and patients' perspectives on their health-related quality of life, on how best to initially treat open-angle glaucoma.},

Clinical studies show that CATS and CAMEC provide comparable results to more expensive conventional visual field test devices. A neural network has been designed to classify visual field data from PC-based video-campimeters to facilitate diagnostic interpretation of visual field test results by non-experts. A three-layer back propagation network was designed, with 110 units in the input layer (each unit corresponding to a test point on the visual field test grid), a hidden layer of 40 processing units, and an output layer of 27 units (each one corresponding to a particular type of visual field pattern). The network was trained by a training set of 540 simulated visual field test result patterns, including normal, glaucomatous and neuro-ophthalmic defects, for up to 20 000 cycles. The classification accuracy of the network was initially measured with a previously unseen test set of 135 simulated fields and further tested with a genuine test result set of 100 neurological and 200 glaucomatous fields. A classification accuracy of 91-97% with simulated field results and 65-100% with genuine field results were achieved. This suggests that neural networks incorporated into PC-based video-campimeters may enable correct interpretation of results in non-specialist clinics or in the community.},

Standard achromatic perimetry remains the gold standard for detection of visual field progression. The authors present a practical and clinically relevant review of the main issues involved in detection of early glaucoma as well as detection of visual field progression in eyes with pre-existing glaucomatous damage. After discussing some basic concepts in perimetry, the authors present evidence-based recommendations for criteria to detect earliest evidence of glaucomatous damage with perimetry. The authors will review different event- and trend-based criteria and present data with regard to comparative performance of such criteria. Relevance of using absolute versus corrected threshold data with regard to different criteria is also addressed. At the end, the authors provide practical guidelines for detection of visual field progression in a clinical setting and review issues related to clinical trials.},

Setting: Glaucoma clinic of a teaching hospital. Patients: Thirteen patients with normal-tension glaucoma and asymmetric visual field loss of at least 2.5 dB in the mean defect of the visual field indexes. Interventions: Areas under the optic disc profiles mapped from values for radial sections of the optic disc measured at intervals of 30-degrees and expressed as percentages of the area of a rectangle were obtained from stereophotographs with a computerized image analysis system. Visual fields were tested with automated perimetry (OCTOPUS), using program G1. Main Outcome Measure: Correlation analyses between the interocular differences in the areas under the optic disc profile and the interocular differences in the visual field indexes. Results: The correlation coefficients between the interocular differences in mean defect and those of the area under the optic disc profile in the superior to temporal sections ranged from -.71 to -.61 (.007<P<.028). The interocular differences in loss variance correlated with the differences in the area under the optic disc profile in the superior section (r=-.61, P=.0252).

Design: Observational, cross-sectional evaluation of diagnostic tests. Participants: We included 120 eyes from 50 normal subjects and 70 glaucomatous patients classified by the presence of a repeatable visual field defect for the analysis. Testing: The RNFL thickness was measured by scanning laser polarimetry with variable corneal compensator (GDx-VCC, Carl-Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc). We obtained ONH imaging by means of confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT3; Heidelberg Engineering, GmbH, Dossenheim, Germany). Main Outcome Measures: Sensitivity and specificity for normative classifications, sensitivity at fixed specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for continuous parameters. A logistic marginal regression model and coefficients of variation (CoV) have been used to test and quantify the influence of optic disc size on the diagnostic accuracy of the 3 technologies under investigation. Results: Among continuous parameters average RNFL thickness for Cirrus HD-OCT, nerve fiber indicator for GDx-VCC and cup shape measure for the HRT3 showed the best diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.97, 0.94, and 0.94, respectively. Among normative classifications, the highest sensitivity and specificity were found for OCT average RNFL thickness (75.8% and 94.7%), for GDx superior thickness (77.1% and 97.5%), for HRT3 Moorfields regression analysis result (89.4% and 73.7%) and for HRT3 GPS global (92.3% and 76.5%). The diagnostic performance of HRT3 parameters seemed to be significantly influenced by optic disc size, although the same was not true for Cirrus HD-OCT and GDx VCC. The most steady performers for each imaging device across disc size groups were Cirrus HD-OCT average thickness (CoV, 1.6%), GDx-VCC inferior thickness (CoV, 2.5%), and HRT3 GPS temporal and nasal (CoV, 21.4%). Conclusions: The diagnostic accuracy of quantitative RNFL assessment as performed by Cirrus HD-OCT and GDx-VCC is high and virtually unaffected or only minimally affected by the size of the optic disc and may provide more consistent diagnostic outcomes across small and large discs than ONH assessment as performed by HRT3.},

Models were combined with UN world population projections for 2010 and 2020 to derive the estimated number with glaucoma. Results: There will be 60.5 million people with OAG and ACG in 2010, increasing to 79.6 million by 2020, and of these, 74% will have OAG. Women will comprise 55% of OAG, 70% of ACG, and 59% of all glaucoma in 2010. Asians will represent 47% of those with glaucoma and 87% of those with ACG.

The linear model fitted the data well. Conclusions: The strongest structure-function associations using SDOCT were found for retinal nerve fiber layer measurements at arcuate areas and inner retinal thickness at the macula measurements.

Methods: Data from 247 glaucoma patients and 142 controls who underwent standard achromatic perimetry (SITA-SAP) and Heidelberg Retina Tomograph III imaging within 6 months were analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity, agreement, and discrimination capability of MRA and GPS were assessed. Results: Age-adjusted specificity was 92% and 93% and sensitivity was 76.88 and 80.85 for GPS and MRA, respectively. Sensitivity for early VF loss [mean deviation (MD) < - 5 dB] (N = 81) was 66.64% and 69.82%, for moderate VF loss (-5dB <MD < -15dB)(N = 104) was 78.91% and 85.13%. and for advanced VF loss (MD > - 15dB) (N = 62) was 87.70% and 86.48% (GPS and MRA, respectively). Age-specific receiver operating characteristics ranged from 0.89 to 0.92 and from 0.87 to 0.90 (GPS and MRA, respectively). Kappa ranged from 0.64 to 0.77. Conclusions: Specificity for MRA and GPS was similar and agreement was good. GPS offered slightly higher age-specific receiver operating characteristic. GPS, which does not require contour line placement, may have a potential role in screening for severe glaucomatous damage.},

Estimates were determined from data on low vision and blindness as defined in the International statistical classification of diseases, injuries and causes of death, 10th revision. The number of people with visual impairment worldwide in 2002 was in excess of 161 million, of whom about 37 million were blind. The burden of visual impairment is not distributed uniformly throughout the world: the least developed regions carry the largest share. Visual impairment is also unequally distributed across age groups, being largely Confined to adults 50 years of age and older A distribution imbalance is also found with regard to gender throughout the world: females have a significantly higher risk of having visual impairment than males. Notwithstanding the progress in surgical intervention that has been made in many countries over the last few decades, cataract remains the leading cause of visual impairment in all regions of the world, except in the most developed countries. Other major causes of visual impairment are, in order of importance, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and trachoma.},

  abstract =    {Purpose: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the GDx VCC in the diagnosis of glaucoma. Design: Prospective, comparative, observational, clinic-based case series. Participants: One eye each of 77 healthy subjects and 162 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma of Caucasian racial origin. Healthy subjects had normal visual fields (VFs), healthy-looking optic discs, and intraocular pressures of less than or equal to21 mmHg in both eyes. Glaucoma patients had a reproducible glaucomatous VF defect and a glaucomatous appearance of the optic disc in at least one eye. Methods: All subjects were measured with the GDx VCC with an automated variable corneal compensator. We constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for all available parameters. Subsequently, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, and multilevel likelihood,ratios for the best discriminating parameter in the entire group. In addition, we calculated sensitivity and specificity in patients with mild, moderate, and severe glaucomatous damage separately. Main Outcome Measures: Software-derived parameters TSNIT (temporal, superior, nasal, inferior, temporal) Average, Superior Average, Inferior Average, TSNIT Std. Dev. (standard deviation), and Nerve Fiber Indicator (NFI). Results: The areas under the ROC curve for TSNIT Average, Superior Average, Inferior Average, TSNIT Std. Dev., and NFI were 0.93, 0.94, 0.90, 0.92, and 0.98, respectively. For the best discriminating parameter NFI, the sensitivity and specificity with a cutoff point of greater than or equal to40 were 89.0% and 95.9%, respectively. The multilevel likelihood ratios for glaucoma were 0.07 at NFI values of <35, 1.30 at values between 35 and 44, and 61.50 at values of greater than or equal to44. At the cutoff level of greater than or equal to40, the sensitivities of the NFI for correctly identifying glaucoma patients with mild, moderate, and severe damage were 83.8%, 92.9%, and 90.1%, respectively. Conclusions: The GDx VCC allowed easy, rapid, and accurate discrimination between healthy and glaucomatous eyes. The NFI was the best discriminating parameter. The GDx VCC seems to fulfill criteria for a glaucoma screening device. (C) 2004 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To investigate the relationship between retinal light sensitivity measured with standard automated perimetry (SAP) and retardation of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measured with the GDx VCC (Laser Diagnostic Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA). METHODS. Forty-seven healthy subjects and 101 patients with glaucoma were examined with SAP and with the commercially available scanning laser polarimeter GDx VCC, with automated individualized compensation of anterior segment birefringence. Individual visual field test points and peripapillary RNFL retardation measurements were grouped into six corresponding sectors. The correlation between perimetry and GDx VCC measurements was determined, and the relationship between RNFL retardation and perimetry, expressed both in the standard decibel scale and in an unlogged scale, was described with linear regression analysis. RESULTS. A statistically significant correlation was found in most sectors between perimetry and GDx VCC measurements in patients with glaucoma, but not in healthy subjects. A linear relationship was found between the unlogged sensitivities and GDx VCC measurements for the superotemporal and inferotemporal sectors. In the decibel scale, this relationship was curvilinear. CONCLUSIONS. GDx VCC measurements of the peripapillary RNFL relate well with functional loss in glaucoma. Based on the observed relationships between function and structure, patients with mild to moderate visual field loss in glaucoma may be better monitored with the GDx VCC and patients who have severe loss, with SAP.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To compare the ability of several machine learning classifiers to predict development of abnormal fields at follow-up in ocular hypertensive (OHT) eyes that had normal visual fields in baseline examination. METHODS. The visual fields of 114 eyes of 114 patients with OHT with four or more visual field tests with standard automated perimetry over three or more years and for whom stereophotographs were available were assessed. The mean (+/-SD) number of visual field tests was 7.89 +/- 3.04. The mean number of years covered (+/-SD) was 5.92 +/- 2.34 (range, 2.81-11.77). Fields were classified as normal or abnormal based on Statpac-like methods (Humphrey Instruments, Dublin, CA) and by several machine learning classifiers. The machine learning classifiers were two types of support vector machine (SVM), a mixture of Gaussian (MoG) classifier. a constrained MoG, and a mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG). Specificity was set to 96% for all classifiers, using data from 94 normal eyes evaluated longitudinally. Specificity, cutoffs required confirmation of abnormality. RESULTS. Thirty-two percent (36/114) of the eves converted to abnormal fields during follow-up based on the Statpac-like methods. All 36 were identified by at least one machine classifier. In nearly, all cases, the machine learning classifiers predicted the confirmed abnormality, on average, 3.92 +/- 0.55 years earlier than traditional Statpac-like methods. CONCLUSIONS. Machine learning classifiers can learn complex patterns and trends in data and adapt to create a decision surface without the constraints imposed by statistical classifiers. This adaptation allowed the machine learning classifiers to identify abnormality in visual field converts much earlier than the traditional methods.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To determine whether a variational Bayesian independent component analysis mixture model (vB-ICA-mm), a form of unsupervised machine learning, can be used to identify and quantify areas of progression in standard automated perimetry fields. METHODS. In an earlier study, it was shown that a model using vB-ICA-mm can separate normal fields from fields with six different patterns of visual field loss related to glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) along maximally independent axes. In the present study, an independent group of 191 patient eyes (66 with ocular hypertension (OHT), 12 with suspected glaucoma by field, 61 with suspected glaucoma by disc, and 52 with glaucoma) with five or more standard visual fields under observation for a mean of 6.24 +/- 2.65 years and 8.11 +/- 2.42 visual fields were evaluated with the vB-ICA-mm. In addition, eyes with progressive GON (PGON) were identified (n = 39). Each participant had a series of fields tested, with each field entered independently and placed along the axes of the previously developed model. This allowed change in one pattern of visual field defect (along one axis) to be assessed relative to results other areas of that same field (no change along other axes). Progression was based on a slope falling outside the 5th and the 95th percentile limits of all slopes, with at least two axes not showing such a deviation in a given individual's series of fields. Fields were also scored using Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) and the Early Manifest Glaucoma Treatment Trial (EMGT) criteria. RESULTS. Thirty-two of 191 eyes progressed on vB-ICA-mm by this definition. Of the 32, 22 had field loss at baseline, 7 had only GON, 3 were OHTs and 12 were from the 39 eyes (31%) with PGON. The vB-ICA-mm identified a higher percentage of progressing eyes in each diagnostic category than did AGIS or and the EMGT. CONCLUSIONS. The vB-ICA-mm can quantitatively identify progression in eyes with glaucoma by evaluating change in one or more patterns of the visual field loss while other areas or patterns remain stable. This may enable each eye to contribute to the determination of whether change is caused by true progression or by variability.},

Volunteers over 20 years of age without apparent ophthalmic abnormalities were examined with the SITA-S central 30-2 program followed by the Dynamic 32 program. Eye with corrected visual acuity ≥ 0.8, refraction ≥ -6.0 diopters, and fields with satisfactory levels of reliability in SITA-S and Dynamic were selected.; RESULTS: Sixty-seven eyes from 67 normal individuals of mean age 51.3  16.3 (range 22-76) years satisfied the selection criteria and were analyzed. Mean retinal sensitivity was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher with SITA-S (29.0  2.4 dB) than with Dynamic (26.8  2.1 dB). Changes in retinal sensitivity with increasing age were significantly (P = 0.0003) greater with Dynamic (-0.09  0.04 dB/year; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.10 to -0.08 dB/year) than with SITA-S (-0.07  0.04 dB/year, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.06 dB/year). When classifying the visual field into three areas (central, mid-peripheral, and peripheral), retinal sensitivities with SITA-S were significantly higher in all areas than with Dynamic (P < 0.0001 for all three areas).; CONCLUSION: Differences in Dynamic and SITA-S strategies may contribute to the differences in retinal sensitivities observed in normal individuals. },

Methods: To compare corresponding locations of RGC thickness with total deviation (TD) of 10-2 SAP for 14 patients with glaucoma and 19 controls, an experienced operator hand-corrected automatic segmentation of the combined RGC and inner plexiform layer (RGC + IPL) of 128 horizontal B-scans. To account for displacement of the RGC bodies around the fovea, the location of the SAP test points was adjusted to correspond to the location of the RGC bodies rather than to the photoreceptors, based on published histological findings. For analysis, RGC + IPL thickness vs SAP (TD) data were grouped into 5 eccentricities, from 3.4 degrees to 9.7 degrees radius on the retina with respect to the fovea. Results: The RGC + IPL thickness correlated well with SAP loss within approximately 7.2 of the fovea (Spearman rho = 0.71-0.74). Agreement was worse (0.53-0.65) beyond 7.2 degrees, where the normal RGC layer is relatively thin. A linear model relating RGC + IPL thickness to linear SAP loss provided a reasonable fit for eccentricities within 7.2 degrees. Conclusion: In the central 7.2 degrees, local RGC + IPL thickness correlated well with local sensitivity loss in glaucoma when the data were adjusted for RGC displacement.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To determine whether an unsupervised machine learning classifier can identify patterns of visual field loss in standard visual fields consistent with typical patterns learned by decades of human experience. METHODS. Standard perimetry thresholds for 52 locations plus age from one eye of each of 156 patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) and 189 eyes of healthy subjects were clustered with an unsupervised machine classifier, variational Bayesian mixture of factor analysis (vbMFA). RESULTS. The vbMFA formed five distinct clusters. Cluster 5 held 186 of 189 fields from normal eyes plus 46 from eyes with GON. These fields were then judged within normal limits by several traditional methods. Each of the other four clusters could be described by the pattern of loss found within it. Cluster 1 (71 GON + 3 normal optic discs) included early, localized defects. A purely diffuse component was rare. Cluster 2 (26 GON) exhibited primarily deep superior hemifield defects, and cluster 3 (10 GON) held deep inferior hemifield defects only or in combination with lesser superior field defects. Cluster 4 ( 6 GON) showed deep defects in both hemifields. In other words, visual fields within a given cluster had similar patterns of loss that differed from the predominant pattern found in other clusters. The classifier separated the data based solely on the patterns of loss within the fields, without being guided by the diagnosis, placing 98.4% of the healthy eyes within the same cluster and spreading 70.5% of the eyes with GON across the other four clusters, in good agreement with a glaucoma expert and pattern standard deviation. CONCLUSIONS. Without training-based diagnosis (unsupervised learning), the vbMFA identified four important patterns of field loss in eyes with GON in a manner consistent with years of clinical experience.},

  abstract =    {Visual field examination with fixed stimuli was first realized in manual static profile perimetry. The transition from a linear stimulus alignment along a profile section towards a two-dimensional arrangement introduced the era of static grid perimetry. Application of computer technology nowadays allows automation and standardization of this procedure, which enables the examiner to select the necessary visual field area, the adequate grid, and the optimal strategy for an estimation of differential luminance sensitivity. Furthermore, the computer independently takes over the recording, visualization, and processing of the perimetric procedure. This contribution discusses conventional static visual field examinations since these are widely used, easily accessible, well established for practical application, and standardized. This paper (part 4) explicitly focuses on the correct interpretation of automated static strategies of visual field examinations. Furthermore the classification and scoring of visual field defects as well as quality control, progression analysis, and perimetry in childhood are addressed.

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To assess the spatial distribution of glaucomatous visual field defects (VFDs) obtained with regionally condensed stimulus arrangements. METHODS. Sixty-three eyes of 63 glaucoma subjects were examined with threshold-estimating automated static perimetry (full threshold 4-2-1 dB strategy with at least three reversals) on an automatic campimeter or a full-field perimeter. Stimuli were added by the examiner to regionally enhance spatial resolution in regions that were suspicious for a glaucomatous VFD. These regions were characterized by contiguous local VFDs, attributable to the retinal nerve fiber bundle course according to the impression of the examiner. The added stimulus locations were subsets of a predefined, dense perimetric grid. All VFD locations with P < 0.05 (total deviation plots) were assessed by superimposing the visual field records of all participants. RESULTS. Glaucomatous VFD loss occurred more frequently in the upper than in the lower hemifield, with a typical retinal nerve fiber-related pattern and a preference of the nasal step region. More than 50% of the eyes with predominantly mild to moderate glaucomatous field loss showed defective locations in the immediate superior paracentral region within an eccentricity of 3 degrees. CONCLUSIONS. Conventional thresholding white-on-white perimetry with regionally enhanced spatial resolution reveals that glaucomatous visual field loss affects the immediate paracentral area, especially the upper hemifield, in many eyes with only mild to moderate glaucomatous visual field loss. Detailed knowledge about the spatial pattern and the local frequency distribution of glaucomatous VFDs is an essential prerequisite for creating regionally condensed stimulus arrangements for adequate detection and follow-up of functional glaucomatous damage.

Results: Nerve fiber layer thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography demonstrated a high degree of correlation with functional status of the optic nerve, as measured by visual field examination (P=.0001). Neither cupping of the optic nerve nor neuroretinal rim area were as strongly associated with visual field loss as was NFL thickness (P=.17 and P=.21, respectively). Cupping correlated with NFL thickness only when the cup was small (cup-to-diameter ratio, 0.1 to 0.3) or large (cup-to-diameter ratio, 0.8 to 1.0) (P=.006); there was no correlation between cupping and NFL thickness otherwise. Nerve fiber layer, especially in the inferior quadrant, was significantly thinner in glaucomatous eyes than in normal eyes (P=.04). Finally, we found a decrease in NFL thickness with aging, even when controlling for factors associated with the diagnosis of glaucoma (P=.03). Conclusions: Nerve fiber layer thickness can be measured using optical coherence tomography. These measurements provide good structural and functional correlation with known parameters.},

  abstract =    {Background: Recently the reduction of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) was suggested to be associated with diffuse axonal damage in the whole CNS of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, several points are still under discussion. (1) Is high resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) required to detect the partly very subtle RNFL changes seen in MS patients? (2) Can a reduction of RNFL be detected in all MS patients, even in early disease courses and in all MS subtypes? (3) Does an optic neuritis (ON) or focal lesions along the visual pathways, which are both very common in MS, limit the predication of diffuse axonal degeneration in the whole CNS? The purpose of our study was to determine the baseline characteristics of clinical definite relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) MS patients with high resolution OCT technique. Methodology: Forty-two RRMS and 17 SPMS patients with and without history of uni- or bilateral ON, and 59 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were analysed prospectively with the high resolution spectral-domain OCT device (SD-OCT) using the Spectralis 3.5mm circle scan protocol with locked reference images and eye tracking mode. Furthermore we performed tests for visual and contrast acuity and sensitivity (ETDRS, Sloan and Pelli-Robson-charts), for color vision (Lanthony D-15), the Humphrey visual field and visual evoked potential testing (VEP). Principal Findings: All 4 groups (RRMS and SPMS with or without ON) showed significantly reduced RNFL globally, or at least in one of the peripapillary sectors compared to age-/sex-matched healthy controls. In patients with previous ON additional RNFL reduction was found. However, in many RRMS patients the RNFL was found within normal range. We found no correlation between RNFL reduction and disease duration (range 9-540 months). Conclusions: RNFL baseline characteristics of RRMS and SPMS are heterogeneous (range from normal to markedly reduced levels).},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze glaucomatous eyes that show discordance between structure and function and hypothesize plausible anatomical explanations for discordance. METHODS: Fifty eyes from 50 consecutive subjects with glaucoma (which was diagnosed according to multicenter criteria) were studied. One eye from each subject was selected randomly for inclusion, counterbalancing right eye (O.D.) and left eye (O.S.). By comparing the available structural information (from clinical disc assessment as well as GDx retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL] measurements) to the Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) Standard 24-2 (SS24-2) visual field results, study eyes were assigned to the following categories: ( I) positive structure-function correlation, (2) structural abnormalities with no functional deficits, and (3) functional abnormalities with no structural deficits. Structure and function also were compared on a statistical basis, utilizing the nerve fiber indicator (NFI) of the GDx and the mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) of SS24-2 visual fields. RESULTS: Forty-four eyes were classified in category 1,5 eyes in category 2, and 1 eye in category 3. Scatter plots showing the relationship between the NFI and MD and between the NFI and PSD depict a positive correlation in the 44 category 1 eyes with R(2) values of 0.465 and 0.322, respectively. The remaining 6 eyes with discordant structural and functional findings were analyzed in detail. CONCLUSION: The majority (88%) of glaucoma cases show concordance between structural loss and functional deficits. The primary proposed explanations for discordance include (1) visual field sampling and test selection limitations (i.e., the SS24-2 samples only axons that are anatomically connected to photoreceptors in the central retina, whereas the GDx samples virtually all axons) and (2) GDx measurement limitations in the papillo-macula bundle (i.e., the GDx has difficulty differentiating the normally thin RNFL from the pathologically even thinner RNFL). Tests of both structure and function are recommended in glaucoma suspects and patients, as neither mode is capable of identifying all glaucomatous deficits. Due to the apparent diagnostic benefit that the peripheral functional data may provide, we strongly recommend that future studies evaluating the structure function relationship in glaucoma record peripheral (60-4) visual fields for all subjects at the outset of the study.

In 83 eyes, glaucomatous field defects developed that met rigid criteria on manual kinetic and suprathreshold static perimetry.

The more sensitive of the two identified nerve fiber layer defects in 88% of readable photographs at the time field loss first occurred; 60% (6/10) of eyes already had nerve fiber layer defects 6 years before field loss.  In contrast, the nerve fiber layer was considered abnormal in only 11% (3/27) of normal eyes and 26% (84/327) of hypertensive eyes.  The location of nerve fiber layer and field defects closely corresponded, but nerve fiber layer loss was generally more wide-spread.

Nerve fiber layer defects expanded with time, often by the development and coalescence of adjacent areas of damage.},

  abstract =    {There have been several reports on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to visual field classification. While these have demonstrated that neural networks can be used with good results they have not explored the effects that the training set can have upon network performance nor emphasized the unique value of ANNs in visual field analysis. This paper considers the problem of differentiating normal and glaucomatous visual fields and explores different training set characteristics using field data collected from a Henson CFS2000 perimeter. Training set properties including size, balance between normals and glaucomas, extent of field loss and the spatial location of glaucomatous defects are explored. A multilayer network with 132 input nodes, 20 hidden layer nodes and 2 output nodes is trained using an error backpropagation algorithm. Both sensitivity and specificity are measured during testing. The results demonstrate that large random sets are better than small random sets since sensitivity improves with size and specificity is not adversely affected. The variability in performance also reduces as training set size increases. In addition, sets that are biased towards glaucoma examples are more sensitive and less specific, while sets biased with normal examples are more specific and less sensitive than balanced sets. Thus large training sets with class balance are generally desirable for good sensitivities and specificities. The actual glaucoma examples contained in the set are also important. A training set deficient in examples of early loss produce poor sensitivities and good specificities, while an absence of advanced loss training examples has no detrimental effect on sensitivity or specificity. The spatial distribution of defects is also crucial. Spatially biased sets are unable to recognize defects that occur in locations where no previous defect has been presented while more balanced sets lead to better performance. In conclusion the 'ideal' training set should contain many examples of early defects that represent the full range of locations where these defects may occur.},

Design: The authors prospectively studied the relation between the precise locations of disc hemorrhages and retinal nerve fiber layer defects in the first part of the study. The authors also compared morphometrically the peripapillary atrophy and the optic disc in eyes with disc hemorrhage with eyes without a history of disc hemorrhage in age-matched patients in the second part of the study. Participants: In part 1, 42 patients with NTG (male/female = 11/31; age, 56.8 +/- 14.2 years) in whom new disc hemorrhages developed were enrolled. In part 2, 51 randomly selected age-matched patients with NTG without a history of disc hemorrhage (male/female = 16/35; age, 55.7 +/- 12.5) were examined. Main Outcome Measure: In part 1, retinal nerve fiber layer defects were observed by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy using an argon-blue laser. In part 2, the area, angular extent, and radial extent of zone beta of peripapillary atrophy and the structural parameters of optic disc were measured by scanning laser tomography using a diode laser. Results: in part 1, the authors detected 64 disc hemorrhages in 48 eyes of 42 patients; retinal nerve fiber layer defects were shown in 47 (97.9%) of 48 eyes by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Of 64 disc hemorrhages, 51 (79.7%) coincided with retinal nerve fiber layer defects in location. These 51 hemorrhages were present on the border (41.2%) or adjacent to the border (58.8%) between the retinal nerve fiber layer defect and the apparently healthy-looking retinal nerve fiber layer. In part 2, the prevalence, area, angular extent of zone beta, and ratio of zone beta area to disc area were significantly greater in the disc hemorrhage group than in the nonhemorrhage group, even though there were no significant differences in disc parameters between the two groups. Conclusions: Disc hemorrhage is associated closely with retinal nerve fiber layer defect in location and the size of peripapillary atrophy in NTG.},

  abstract =    {Background: Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive ocular neuropathy that leads to the loss of retinal ganglion cells and varying degrees of visual impairment or blindness. Management: There are three major factors to consider in the management of patients with glaucoma. First, extensive damage to retinal ganglion cells often can occur before the appearance of any functional deficits is detected by perimetry. Second, the rate of glaucoma progression varies considerably among different patients and even for the same patient at different times. Third, the lack of correspondence between structural and functional change may reflect the limitations of current assays in measuring each. Given the variability of disease progression, early detection and continued vigilance of both structure and function in the form of regular patient monitoring are essential. Conclusion: This review presents six case histories that demonstrate the differing rates of progression that may be observed in the clinic and the importance of early detection and treatment in controlling the disease. In addition, major lessons from randomised clinical trials are summarised, including the likelihood of progression from diagnosed ocular hypertension to the development of glaucoma, the risks of progression of established glaucoma and the effectiveness of therapy.},

Of the 26 patients, 22 had interocular asymmetry of the optic disc area of at least 0.01 mm2 and of mean IOP of at least 0.3 mmHg. Of these 22 patients, 8 had the higher mean IOP in the eye with the larger optic disc. In these 8 patients, the visual field defect was significantly more advanced in the eye with the larger optic disc (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, P<0.05).

Recently, there has been an explosion in the amount of data being stored on patients who suffer from visual deterioration including field test data, retinal image data and patient demographic data. However, there has been relatively little work in modelling the spatial and temporal relationships common to such data. In this paper we introduce a novel method for classifying visual field (VF) data that explicitly models these spatial and temporal relationships. Methodology: We carry out an analysis of our proposed spatio-temporal. Bayesian classifier and compare it to a number of classifiers from the machine learning and statistical communities. These are all tested on two datasets of VF and clinical data. We investigate the receiver operating characteristics curves, the resulting network structures and also make use of existing anatomical knowledge of the eye in order to validate the discovered models. Results: Results are very encouraging showing that our classifiers are comparable to existing statistical models whilst also facilitating the understanding of underlying spatial and temporal relationships within VF data. The results reveal the potential of using such models for knowledge discovery within ophthalmic databases, such as networks reflecting the 'nasal step', an early indicator of the onset of glaucoma. Conclusion: The results outlined in this paper pave the way for a substantial program of study involving many other spatial and temporal datasets, including retinal image and clinical data. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, there has been an explosion in the amount of data being stored on patients who suffer from visual deterioration, including visual field (VF) test, retinal image, and frequent intraocular pressure measurements. Like the progression of many biological and medical processes, VF progression is inherently temporal in nature. However, many datasets associated with the study of such processes are often cross sectional and the time dimension is not measured due to the expensive nature of such studies. In this paper, we address this issue by developing a method to build artificial time series, which we call pseudo time series from cross-sectional data. This involves building trajectories through all of the data that can then, in turn, be used to build temporal models for forecasting (which would otherwise be impossible without longitudinal data). Glaucoma, like many diseases, is a family of conditions and it is, therefore, likely that there will be a number of key trajectories that are important in understanding the disease. In order to deal with such situations, we extend the idea of pseudo time series by using resampling techniques to build multiple sequences prior to model building. This approach naturally handles outliers and multiple possible disease trajectories. We demonstrate some key properties of our approach on synthetic data and present very promising results on VF data for predicting glaucoma.},

  volume =      {52},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. The test-retest variability of standard automated perimetry (SAP) severely limits its ability to detect sensitivity decline. Numerous improvements in procedures have been proposed, but assessment of their benefits requires quantification of how much variability reduction results in meaningful benefit. This article determines how much reduction in SAP procedure variability is necessary to permit earlier detection of visual field deterioration. METHOD. Computer simulation and statistical analysis were used. Gaussian distributions were fit to the probability of observing any sensitivity measurement obtained with SAP and the Full Threshold algorithm to model current variability. The standard deviation of these Gaussians was systematically reduced to model a reduction of SAP variability. Progression detection ability was assessed by using pointwise linear regression on decreases of -1 and -2 dB/year from 20 and 30 dB, with a custom criteria that fixed detection specificity at 95%. Test visits occurring twice and thrice per annum are modeled, and analysis was performed on single locations and whole fields. RESULTS. A 30% to 60% reduction in SAP variability was required to detect pointwise deterioration 1 year earlier than current methods, depending on progression rate and visit frequency. A reduction of 20% in variability generally allowed progression to be detected one visit earlier. CONCLUSIONS. On average, the variability of SAP procedures must be reduced by approximately 20% for a clinically appreciable improvement in detection of visual field change. Analysis similar to that demonstrated can measure the improvement required of new procedures, assisting in cost-benefit assessment for the adoption of new techniques, before lengthy and expensive clinical trials.

  abstract =    {Purpose. To determine which structural optic nerve head parameters measured with confocal scanning laser image analysis that best discriminate between normal persons and those with glaucoma. Methods. One randomly selected eye of 53 patients with early open-angle glaucoma (average visual field mean deviation=-4.8 dB) and of 43 age-, race-, and refractive error-matched normal subjects were studied. The performance of nine structural measures was evaluated with linear multivariate analysis and a neural network: cup area, cup to disc area ratio, rim area, height variation contour, cup volume, rim volume, cup shape measure, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and retinal nerve fiber layer cross-section area. A discriminant function was derived with two thirds of the sample and its discriminant power tested on the remaining one third. This was repeated twice so that the entire sample was used for training and testing. A neural network was trained and tested in the same way. Stereoscopic color optic nerve photographs of the same eyes were evaluated qualitatively by three experienced, masked observers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of discriminant function, neural network results, and qualitative evaluation were plotted. Comparisons of the areas under the ROC curves were performed with nonparametric statistics. Results. There were statistically significant differences between the normal and glaucoma groups for all measures (P less than or equal to 0.007) except for height variation contour, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and retinal nerve fiber layer cross-section area, Cup shape measure provided the single best measure to distinguish between normal subjects and those with early glaucoma and had a diagnostic precision of 84%. Neural network diagnostic precision, when all measures were used, was 92% and decreased to 82% when cup shape measure was omitted. The area under the ROC curve when all measures were combined was 0.94; it was significantly lower (P=0.04) when cup shape measure was omitted (area=0.84). The area under the ROC curve for qualitative optic disc evaluation by experienced observers was 0.93. There was no statistically significant difference between qualitative evaluation and neural network performance (P=0.80). Conclusions. Cup shape measure, the statistical third moment of the distribution of depth values of the optic nerve head obtained with confocal laser image analysis, can be used to discriminate between normal persons and those with early glaucomatous damage with high diagnostic precision.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To investigate whether asymmetry in hemifield macular thickness can serve as an early indicator of glaucomatous structural damage using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. METHODS. Five zones in the macular thickness map were defined. Each zone included reciprocal areas in the superior and inferior hemifield. Differences in average retinal thickness (DRT) between corresponding regional pairs were measured in each of the five zones in 50 healthy eyes. An abnormality was defined as the DRT value lying outside the 95% confidence intervals. An eye was considered to yield an "abnormal macular hemifield test" (MHT) if abnormality was evident in any zone. The sensitivity and specificity for glaucoma detection of MHT and average circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cRNFL) classification were determined. RESULTS. A total of 114 healthy, 103 glaucoma-suspect, and 74 glaucomatous eyes were included. Overall, 5.8%, 36.9%, 88.4%, and 77.4% of the eyes of the healthy, glaucoma-suspect (GS), early glaucoma (EG), and advanced glaucoma (AG) groups yielded abnormal MHT results, respectively. In EG eyes, the sensitivity of an abnormal MHT result was significantly greater than that of abnormal average cRNFL classification (P = 0.008). In the GS and AG groups, the sensitivity did not significantly differ between an abnormal MHT result and an average cRNFL classification (P = 0.880, 0.180). Compared with sectoral cRNFL thickness measurements, MHT showed a similar level of diagnostic performance. Specificity was not different between an abnormal MHT result and an average cRNFL classification (P = 0.687). CONCLUSIONS. Evaluation of asymmetry in hemifield macular thickness may serve as an assessment tool in the early diagnosis of glaucoma. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2012;53:1139-1144) DOI:10.1167/iovs.11-8373},

To compare the performance characteristics of seven methods for analyzing glaucomatous visual field progression, using a combination of real patient data and computer simulation techniques. METHODS. The initial and final visual field results, separated by 7 years and measured with the full-threshold 30-2 program of the Humphrey Field Analyzer (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) of 76 patients with open-angle glaucoma were used. A computer simulation program generated 14 interim semiannual visual fields under conditions of high, moderate, and no variability. Progression was analyzed using the methods of the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS), the Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS), three criteria based on the Glaucoma Change Probability (GCP) analysis, and two criteria based on point-wise linear regression analysis (PLRA). Specificities were calculated by using the same visual field of each patient as both the initial and final field (no progression) under conditions of moderate and high variability. RESULTS. Under the no-variability condition, progression rates were 18% for the AGIS, 36% for CIGTS, 47% to 62% for the three GCP methods, and 72% and 84% for the two PLRA methods. Progression rates increased with greater variability with the three GCP methods and decreased with all other methods. The time to detect confirmed progression was longest for the PLRA methods and shortest for the CIGTS and GCP methods. Under the moderate-variability condition, all methods yielded high specificity. The AGIS, CIGTS, and one of the GCP and PLRA methods were relatively resistant to high variability and maintained high specificities. CONCLUSIONS. The AGIS and CIGTS methods had high specificity, but classified fewer cases of progression than the other methods. The GCP methods determined progression earliest; however, they were generally not as specific. Methods based on PLRA were specific but times to confirmed progression were the longest.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. Standard automated perimetry (SAP) shows a marked increase in variability in damaged areas of the visual field. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that larger stimuli are associated with more uniform variability, by investigating the retest variability of four perimetry tests: standard automated perimetry size III (SAP III), with the SITA standard strategy; SAP size V (SAP V), with the full-threshold strategy; Matrix (FDT II), and Motion perimetry. METHODS. One eye each of 120 patients with glaucoma was examined on the same day with these four perimetric tests and retested 1 to 8 weeks later. The decibel scales were adjusted to make the test's scales numerically similar. Retest variability was examined by establishing the distributions of retest threshold estimates, for each threshold level observed at the first test. The 5th and 95th percentiles of the retest distribution were used as point-wise limits of retest variability. Regression analyses were performed to quantify the relationship between visual field sensitivity and variability. RESULTS. With SAP III, the retest variability increased substantially with reducing sensitivity. Corresponding increases with SAP V, Matrix, and Motion perimetry were considerably smaller or absent. With SAP III, sensitivity explained 22% of the retest variability (r(2)), whereas corresponding data for SAP V, Matrix, and Motion perimetry were 12%, 2%, and 2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Variability of Matrix and Motion perimetry does not increase as substantially as that of SAP III in damaged areas of the visual field. Increased sampling with the larger stimuli of these techniques is the likely explanation for this finding. These properties may make these stimuli excellent candidates for early detection of visual field progression. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2009; 50: 974-979) DOI: 10.1167/iovs.08-1789},

  abstract =    {Objective.-A confocal scanning diode laser ophthalmoscope was used to determine the number of examinations needed to obtain highly reproducible topographic measurements of the optic nerve head and peripapillary retina. Design.-Topographic images of the optic nerve head and peripapillary retina were obtained in one randomly selected eye on five separate visits. On each occasion the selected eye had five examinations. For each examination, one image was acquired (a total of 25 images per eye). Reproducibility was calculated as the average SD of all image elements (65 536 pixels). Setting.-Glaucoma referral center. Subjects.-Five normal subjects and five patients with glaucoma. Intervention.-Topographic imaging of the optic nerve head and peripapillary retina. Main Outcome Measure.-Number of examinations needed to obtain highly reproducible topographic measurements. Results.-In healthy subjects, reproducibility with one examination per visit was 35.5 mum; this improved to 25.7 mum with three examinations and 22.5 mum with five examinations. In older patients with glaucoma, the reproducibility improved from 40.2 mum with one examination per visit to 28.5 and 24.1 mum with three and five examinations, respectively. Conclusion.-We recommend a series of three examinations to provide high reproducibility with optimal efficiency in terms of time and materials used.},

  abstract =    {Objectives: To study familial aggregation of primary open-angle glaucoma in a general population and to determine the absolute and relative risks for first-degree relatives. Methods: First-degree relatives of patients with glaucoma (n = 48) and control subjects (n = 155) from the population-based Rotterdam Study underwent a standardized examination, including perimetry. Main Outcome Measures: Intraocular pressure; vertical cup-disc ratio; and the presence of glaucoma, defined as a visual field defect with a cup-disc ratio of 0.7 or higher or asymmetry of 0.3 or higher between both eyes. Results: The prevalence of glaucoma was 10.4% in siblings of patients, 1.1% in offspring of patients, 0.7% in siblings of controls, and 0% in offspring of controls. Lifetime risk of elevated intraocular pressure in relatives of patients srs relatives of controls was 42.5% vs 6.7%, of enlarged cup-disc ratio was 62.2% vs 16.6%, and of glaucoma was 22.0% vs 2.3%, yielding a risk ratio for glaucoma of 9.2 (95% confidence interval= 1.2-73.9). The population-attributable risk of glaucoma was 16.4%. Conclusions: In a general population, relatives of patients with glaucoma have a strongly increased risk of glaucoma. Enlarged cup-disc ratio, not intraocular pressure, was the earliest and most prominent feature of familial aggregation. Further studies are needed to disentangle the genetic components of the increased familial risk.},

  abstract =    {To assess the temporal relationship between visual field progression and optic disc deterioration in early glaucoma, we studied 15 patients with unilateral visual field loss from primary open angle glaucoma. Planimetric optic disc measurements were compared with automated static threshold perimetry during a mean follow-up of 6.1 years. Eight (53%) of 15 eyes with an initially normal visual field showed progression of the disc; six of these eyes did not develop field abnormalities. The mean rates of rim-area loss were 1.7%/y in eyes with initially normal fields and 2.1%/y in eyes with initial field loss. The mean rate of visual field deterioration (change in corrected loss variance) was lower in the eyes with an initially normal field (0.3 dB2/y) than in eyes with initial field loss (3.6 dB2/y; P=.016). This longitudinal study documents progressive disc damage prior to field loss in early glaucoma.},

  abstract =    {PURPOSE. To develop and validate a method of predicting visual function from retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) structure in glaucoma. METHODS. RNFL thickness (RNFLT) measurements from scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) and visual field (VF) sensitivity from standard automated perimetry were made available for 535 eyes from three centers. In a training dataset, structure-function relationships were characterized by using linear regression and a type of neural network: radial basis function customized under a Bayesian framework (BRBF). These two models were used in a test dataset to (1) predict sensitivity at individual VF locations from RNFLT measurements and (2) predict the spatial relationship between VF locations and positions at a peripapillary RNFLT measurement annulus. Predicted spatial relationships were compared with a published anatomic structure-function map. RESULTS. Compared with linear regression, BRBF yielded a nearly twofold improvement (P < 0.001; paired t-test) in performance of predicting VF sensitivity in the test dataset (mean absolute prediction error of 2.9 dB [SD 3.7] versus 4.9 dB [SD 4.0]). The predicted spatial structure-function relationship showed better agreement (P < 0.001; paired t-test) with anatomic prior knowledge when the BRBF was compared with the linear regression (median absolute angular difference of 15 degrees vs. 62 degrees). CONCLUSIONS. The BRBF generates clinically useful relationships that relate topographical maps of RNFL measurement to VF locations and allows the VF sensitivity to be predicted from structural measurements. This method may allow clinicians to evaluate structural and functional measures in the same domain. It could also be generalized to use other structural measures.

  abstract =    {Objective: To evaluate a new method of quantifying and visualizing discordance between structural and functional measurements in glaucomatous eyes by predicting the visual field (VF) from retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) using a bayesian radial basis function. Methods: Five GDx VCC RNFLT scans and 5 Humphrey 24-2 Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm VF tests were performed for 50 glaucomatous eyes from 50 patients. A best-available estimate (BAE) of the true VF was calculated as the pointwise median of these 5 replications. This BAE VF was compared with every RNFLT-predicted VF from the bayesian radial basis function and every measured VF. Predictability of VFs from RNFLT was established from previous data. A structure-function pattern discordance map and a structure-function discordance index (scores of 0-1) were established from the predictability limits for each structure-function measurement pair to quantify and visualize the discordance between the structure-predicted and measured VFs. Results: The mean absolute difference between the structure-predicted and BAE VFs was 3.9 dB. The mean absolute difference between measured and BAE VFs was 2.6 dB. The mean (SD) structure-function discordance index score was 0.34 (0.11). Ninety-seven (39%) of the structure-predicted VFs showed significant discordance (structure-function discordance index score >0.3) from measured VFs. Conclusions: On average, the bayesian radial basis function predicts the BAEVF from RNFLT slightly less well than a measured VF from the 5 VFs composing the BAE VF. The pattern discordance map highlights locations with structure-function discordance, with the structure-function discordance index providing a summary index. These tools may help clinicians trust the mutually confirmatory structure-function measurements with good concordance or identify unreliable ones with poor concordance.},
